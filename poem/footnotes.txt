5–6. According to Horace, the epic poet should begin in medias res.
7. Center. Hell was not, as some thought, in the center of the earth.
17. Fathers. Church Fathers writing in the early Christian centuries, e.g., Jerome, Origen, Basil, Chrysostom,
Gregory of Nazianzen. See Milton’s Christian Doctrine, 1.7.
1–26. The first Proem contains the epic statement of theme (1–5) and the invocation.
4. Christ, the second Adam.
6. See 7.1 and note. Urania, the Greek Muse of astronomy, had been made into the Muse of Christian
poetry by Du Bartas and other religious poets. Here she is identified as the Muse that inspired biblical
prophet-poets.
8. Moses, thought to be the author of Genesis and the other four books of the Pentateuch, was tending sheep
on Mount Horeb (“Oreb”) when God spoke to him from a burning bush (Exod. 3:1– 2); he received the
Law on the highest peak, “Sinai.”
chosen Seed. The Jews.
9–10 In the Beginning. Echoes Gen. 1:1; Milton thought God created the universe out of unformed matter
(“Chaos”), not out of nothing.
Sion Hill. Mount Zion, associated with the biblical poet David (reputed
author of many psalms); also the site of Solomon’s Temple with its songs and ceremonies.
11–12 Siloa’s Brook. Siloah, a pool near Mount Zion (Neh. 3:15); it parallels Aganippe, the Muses’ spring.
Also Siloam, the pool where Jesus cured a blind man (John 9:1–11).
Oracle. Mount Zion as site of
Divine teaching and prophecy (Isa. 2:3).
15 Aonian Mount. Mount Helicon, home of the classical Muses.
16. The line translates Ariosto, Orlando Furioso 1.2.2: “Cosa non detta in prosa mai, né in rima.”
17 Spirit. Probably the creative power of God (see Milton’s commentary on Gen. 1:2 in Christian Doctrine,
1.7), but possibly the Holy Spirit, understood in antitrinitarian terms (ch. 6).
17–22. A composite of biblical phrases (e.g., Gen. 1:2, 1 Cor. 3:16, Mark 1:10, Luke 3:22, and John 1:32).
Milton’s brooding image comes from the Hebrew, accurately translated in the Tremellius Latin Bible
(“incubabat”).
27. An opening question like this is an epic convention. Compare Aeneid 1.8, “Musa, mihi causas memora”
(“Tell me the cause, O Muse”).
33. Compare Iliad 1.8, asking who first sowed discord among the Greeks.
34. See Rev. 12:9: “that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan.” The description of Satan’s fall (42 – 9) echoes
Isa. 14:12–15, Luke 10:18, and Jude 6.
48. Adamant was a mythical substance of great hardness.
50. Alludes to the analogous fall of the defeated Titans in Greek myth (Hesiod, Theogony 664 –735), who fell
nine days from heaven to earth and nine more into Tartarus.
66. The phrase alludes to the inscription over Dante’s Hell, “All hope abandon, you who enter here” (Inferno
3.9) and to Euripides, Troades 681, “to me even hope, that remains to all mortals, never comes.”
74. Milton here describes the distance from Heaven to Hell as three times the distance from the center (earth)
to the outermost sphere. Cf. other descriptions of the universe at 2.1051–3 and 8.66 –170.
81. The Phoenician sun god Baal (the name in Hebrew means “Lord of the Flies”); in Matt. 12:24 he is called
“the prince of the devils.” Like Satan (whose name in Hebrew means “Adversary”) and the other fallen
angels, he is now known by the name he will bear in Hell and as a pagan deity.
84–5. Satan’s opening words recall Aeneas’ vision of the ghost of Hector on the night of Troy’s fall, “so changed
from the living Hector” (Aeneid 2.274–5).
105. Cf. 6.833–4.
116–17 Gods. Usually angels (cf. 3.341), whose substance is “empyreal” (fiery, the substance of the highest
heaven). But Satan sometimes uses “Gods” to imply a pagan pantheon (cf. 5.70 – 81, 9.718–30).
128–9. According to tradition there were nine orders of angels arranged hierarchically: Seraphim, Cherubim,
Thrones, Dominations, Virtues, Powers, Principalities, Archangels, and Angels. The poem uses some of
these titles, but does not keep the hierarchy.
180
183–91. Five of these lines rhyme.
196 rood. An old unit of linear measure (6–8 yards), or the fourth part of an acre.
198–9. Both the Titans (led by “Briareos,” said to have a hundred hands) and the Giants, represented by “Typhon”
(who lived near Tarsus and was said to have a hundred serpent heads) made war on Jove. They were cast
into the underworld in punishment (Hesiod, Theogony 713–16, 820–85). Christian mythographers (and Milton)
often interpreted myths as analogues to the story of Satan’s rebellion and fall.
200–1. The whale, often identified with the great sea-monster and enemy of the Lord in Isa. 27:1, and the
crocodile-like dragon of Job 41:1–34, who is “king over all the children of pride.” Both were commonly
identified with Satan.
203–8. The story of the deceived sailor and the illusory island was a commonplace (see, e.g., Orlando Furioso
6.37–41) often applied to Satan.
230–7 subterranean wind. Thought to be the cause of earthquakes.
Pelorus. Cape Faro, a promontory on the east of Sicily, near the volcanic Mount “Ætna.” Cf. Aeneid 3.570 –7, Virgil’s description of Etna
darkening Pelorus with its smoke.
254–6. Compare Satan’s soliloquy, 4:75–8.
262–3. The sentiment, and its opposite, were proverbial. Cf. Phineas Fletcher, The Purple Island, 7.10, “In
heav’n they scorn’d to serve, so now in hell they reigne.” See also Abdiel (PL 6.183 –5).
266 oblivious pool. Suggests Lethe (forgetfulness), one of the classical rivers of Hades.
284–7. Cf. Achilles’ shield, Iliad 19.373.
290
285. Ethereal. Tempered with celestial fire.
288–91. Galileo studied the moon with a powerful telescope (“Optic Glass”) which as “Artist” (artifex) he
made. He did so from the hill town of Fiesole (“Fesole”) outside Florence and from the valley of the Arno
(“Valdarno”), in Tuscany. Milton visited him in 1638 or 1639.
292–4. Ships’ masts were customarily made from “Norwegian” fir trees. Cf. Homer’s comparison of
Polyphemus’ club to the mast of a “black ship” (Odyssey 9.322–3).
302–4 Similes comparing the numberless dead to fallen leaves are frequent in epic (e.g. Aeneid 6.309 –10).
Vallombrosa. Shady valley; a wooded region high in the Apennines, about 20 miles from Florence in the
region anciently known as “Etrurea.”
305–12. The constellation Orion (representing an armed giant) was associated with stormy weather (Amos
5:8; Aeneid 1.535, 7.719).
Busiris was a mythical Egyptian pharaoh identified by Milton with the pharaoh
of Exod. 14, who pursued the Israelites (formerly “Sojourners of Goshen” in Egypt) into the Red Sea; it
rolled back for them but inundated the Egyptians (“Memphian Chivalry”).
338–43 Amrams Son. Moses (Exod. 6:20), who with his rod called down a plague of locusts on Egypt “so
that the land was darkened” (Exod. 10:12–15; PL 12.184 –8).
348 Sultan. The title of the Ottoman emperors, connoting despotism.
351–5. The barbarian invasions of Rome began with northern tribes crossing the Rhine (“Rhene”) and
Danube (“Danaw”) rivers, then spreading across Spain via “Gibralter” into North Africa (“Lybian sands”).
363 Books of Life. Record of the names of the faithful (Rev. 3:5 and 21:27).
373. Tertullian, Origen, Augustine, and others identified the pagan gods with the fallen angels, and the belief
continued to Milton’s time.
376. The catalogue of the gods here is an epic convention. Homer catalogues commanders and ships, Virgil,
warriors; both begin with an invocation to the Muse (Iliad 2.484; Aeneid 7.641).
381–91. The first group of devil-idols settled in the Middle East, close neighbors of “Jehovah” whose seat was
in Jerusalem (“Sion”). Milton draws many details about them from John Selden’s De Diis Syris.
386–7 Cherubim. Golden Cherubim adorned opposite ends of the gold cover on the Ark of the Covenant,
where Jehovah was “thron’d” (2 Kgs 19:15; Ps. 80:1).
392–9 Moloch. In Hebrew, “King.” A god of the Ammonites, usually represented with a calf ’s head crowned.
Rabba (“city of waters”) is modern Amman in Jordan; the towns “Argob” and “Basan,” and the river “Arnon”
lie east of the Dead Sea. Children were sacrificed by being placed alive in Moloch’s red-hot brazen image
while “Timbrels” sounded to cover their cries (2 Kgs 23:10).
403–5 that opprobrious Hill. 1 Kgs 11:7: the Mount of Olives. Under the names “Tophet” and “Gehenna,”
the “Valley of Hinnom” (2 Kgs 23:10) adjacent to Jerusalem became a “Type of Hell.” Groves throughout
the Old Testament are associated with idolatry.
406–11 Chemos. Moabite fertility god, associated with the phallic god Priapus; his priests were said to
defecate ritually before his shrine. Their lands (many taken from Isa. 15 –16) are mentioned in these lines.
Seon. Sihon, king of the Ammonites.
Asphaltick Pool. The Dead Sea. “Asphaltick” refers to its deposits
of bitumen.
412–14 Peor. The story of Peor seducing the Israelites in “Sittim” and the resulting “woe,” a plague killing
24,000, is told in Num. 25:1–9.
416 Hill of scandal. The Mount of Olives, where Solomon built temples to Chemos and Moloch (1 Kgs 11:7).
418 Josiah. A reforming king of Judah, Josiah destroyed the groves and idols of Moloch, Chemos, Astoreth,
and Bael (2 Kgs 23:4–14).
419–21. Palestine is bordered by the “Euphrates” on the east and the “Brook” of Besor on the Egyptian border (1 Sam. 30:10).
422 Baalim and Ashtaroth. Plural forms of the sun god Baal and the moon goddess Astoreth (438; “Astarte,”
439). Baal means Lord, and is used as a prefix, e.g., Baal-Peor.
439–41 Astarte. The Phoenician (“Sidonian,” from the city Sidon) original of Aphrodite, with a bull’s head
above her own from which sprang “crescent Horns” (Nativity Ode, 200).
443–6 th’ offensive Mountain. The Mount of Olives where “uxorious” King Solomon, whom God gave a
“large” heart, built a temple for “Astoreth” at the behest of his many wives (2 Kgs 23:13; 1 Kgs 4:29, 11:1–8).
446–52 Thammuz. A Syrian god; his Greek form was “Adonis,” beloved of Aphrodite, metamorphosed into
the anemone. Annual festivals identify his death in “Lebanon” from a boar’s wound and his revival, with
the death and rebirth of vegetation. Here, “Adonis” is a Lebanese river, so named because each July it
turned blood red from iron-rich clay.
455 Ezekiel. Ezek. 8:12–16 describes women’s “dark” idolatrous rites for Thammuz in the “Porch” and men’s
worship of the sun within the Temple.
457–63. When the Philistines stole the Ark of God they placed it in the temple of their sea-god, Dagon ( halfman, half-fish) but his statue fell down and broke in pieces (1 Sam. 5:1–5).
464–6. The five chief cities of the Philistines, sites of Dagon’s worship (see Zeph. 2:4): “Azotus” (Ashdod),
“Gath,” “Ascalon,” “Accaron” (Ekron), and “Gaza” (Azza).
467–76 Rimmon. The chief Syrian god. The Syrian general Naaman was cured of leprosy when (at the prophet
Elisha’s bidding) he bathed in the river Jordan and then renounced Rimmon (2 Kgs 5:1–19); “Abbana” and
“Pharphar” are rivers of “Damascus,” the chief city of Syria. King “Ahaz” of Judah conquered Syria but then
converted to Rimmon’s cult (2 Kgs 16:7–18).
477–82. The second group of devils includes gods originally driven from Olympus by the revolt of the giants
and forced to wander in “brutish” (animal) forms (Ovid, Metamorphoses 5.319–31). The Egyptians later worshiped such animal-headed gods: “Osiris,” a bull; “Isis,” a cow; “Orus” (Horus), a falcon.
482–4. While Moses was receiving the Law his brother Aaron made the “Calf in Oreb” with golden ornaments “borrow’d” (carried out of ) Egypt (Exod. 12:35); the Israelites worshiped the idol, traditionally identified
with the Egyptian god Apis (Exod. 32:1–4).
484–9 Rebel King. Jeroboam led ten tribes in a revolt against Solomon’s son Rehoboam, and “doubled” Aaron’s
sin by making two golden calves, one in “Bethel,” one in “Dan” (1 Kgs 12:19 –30); at the Passover, “Jehovah”
(Exod. 12:12) smote the Egyptian firstborn ( both men and beasts) and all their gods.
490–502 Belial. Hebrew for “worthlessness.” Not a god, but phrases such as “Sons of Belial” ( Judg. 19:22,
20:13, and 2 Cor. 6:15) encouraged personification. The sons of the high priest “Ely,” themselves priests,
were “sons of Belial,” seizing offerings meant for God and lying with prostitutes (1 Sam. 2:12 –22). Milton
invites association with Restoration churches, courts, and cities.
503–5. Lot begged the Sodomites to rape his virgin daughters rather than his angel guests; no rape occurred,
and the angels destroyed “Sodom” (Gen. 19:1–10, 24). At “Gibeah” ( Judg. 19:22–9) an old man prevented
“worse” homosexual rape by surrendering his Levite guest’s concubine to “certain sons of Belial”; she was
raped all night and was found dead the next morning. The change from the biblical concubine to “a Matron”
heightens the crime.
508–10. The Ionian Greeks (“Javans issue,” i.e., of the line of Noah’s grandson Javan, son of Japhet) held the
Titans to be gods, supposedly the progeny of “Heav’n” (Uranus) and “Earth” (Gaea).
510–15 Titan. Titan, the firstborn, was deposed by his younger brother “Saturn” (or Cronos), who was in
turn deposed by his son “Jove” (Zeus) who had been reared in secret in a cave on Mount “Ida” in “Creet”
(Crete).
515–19. The Olympian gods dwelt on Mount “Olympus”; Apollo’s Pythian oracle was at Delphi (“Delphian
Cliff”), high on Mount Parnassus; “Dodona” was an ancient site of Zeus’ oracle; “Doric Land”: Greece.
519–21. The defeated “Saturn” fled over the Adriatic (“Adria”) to Italy (“th’ Hesperian Fields”), to France (“Celtic”
lands) to roam (“the utmost Isles”) of Britain.
534 Azazel. Traditionally, one of the four standard-bearers of Satan’s army; a chief devil in the Book of Enoch.
543. For their “Reign” see 2.894–909, 959–70.
550–4 Phalanx. Greek battle formation consisting of footsoldiers presenting a square, impenetrable thicket
of spears, usually eight ranks deep.
Dorian mood. The Greek musical mode used for solemn
martial music, intended to produce calm firmness (Plato, Republic 3.399A). The Spartans (“Hero’s old”)
marched to battle to the Dorian music of “Flutes.”
573 never since created man. i.e., since man was created (Latin idiom).
575–9. See Iliad 3.1–6 for the war of the pygmies (with a pun on “infantry,” infants) and the “Cranes.” The
Giants fought the Olympian gods at “Phlegra” in Macedonia (Pindar, Nemian Odes 1.67–8); the Greek armies
(“Heroic Race”) fought battles at “Theb’s” and “Ilium” (Troy), aided by various gods.
580–4. Armies from romances include “British” and “Armoric knights” (from Brittany) who fought with Arthur
(“Uthers Son”); and Charlemagne’s army that defeated the Saracens at “Aspramont” (the dark mountain).
Knightly jousts took place at the sites named, all from romances about chivalric wars between Christians
and Saracens: “Montalban” (the white mountain) the home of Rinaldo, “Damasco” (Damascus), “Marocco”
(Marrakesh, a sultanate in what is now Morocco), and “Trebisond” (Trabzon, a Byzantine city on the
Black Sea).
585–7. Saracens gathered at “Biserta” (Bizerte) in Tunisia to invade Spain (Boiardo, Orlando Innamorato 2.29.1–22);
Charlemagne’s rearguard, led by his best knight Roland, was massacred at Roncesvalles, near “Fontarabbia”
(Fuenterrabia, on the Spanish coast). But in no version of the story did Charlemagne himself fall.
597–9. The censor objected to these lines, as perhaps an allusion to the eclipse on the day of Charles II’s
birth, portending “change” (i.e., the Interregnum).
disastrous. astrologically unfavorable (dis + astrum).
620. Satan weeping before his defeated troops recalls Agamemnon stricken with grief in similar circumstances
(Iliad 9.13–14)
32
674 Sulphur. This was thought to be the father of metals.
678 Mammon. An Aramaic word for riches, Mammon came to be personified and associated with the god
of wealth, Plutus, and with Pluto, god of the underworld. Cf. Matt. 6:24: “Ye cannot serve God and
Mammon.”
684 vision beatific. Scholastic term for the sight of God, the greatest joy of heaven.
685–8. Ovid, Metamorphoses 1.138–42, describes men rifling earth’s “bowels” (“viscera terrae”) in search of
riches. Cf. Spenser, Faerie Queene 2.7.17.
694 Babel. The Tower of Babel (cf. Gen. 11:1–9; PL 12.38 – 62).
works. The Pyramids built by
“Memphian” (Egyptian) pharaohs.
711–12 Exhalation. Exhalations were thought to cause comets and meteors ( bad omens) and pestilence
(cf. 10.693–5). Pandæmonium rises to symphonic and vocal music, like Thebes to Amphion’s lyre.
714 Doric pillars. Round and fluted, Doric pillars are severe and plain. Pandæmonium combines classical architectural features with elaborate ornamentation, perhaps suggesting St. Peter’s in Rome.
715–16 Architrave. The beam that rests on top of the columns.
Cornice. The part above and overhanging the frieze.
Freeze. The frieze: the architectural element above the architrave on which
the sculptures usually are set.
717–20 Babilon. Babylon in Assyria had temples to “Belus” (Baal); “Alcairo” (ancient Memphis, near Cairo) had
temples to “Serapis” (composite of Osiris and Apis, the bull god). Both cities were famously magnificent.
728–9 Cressets. Iron baskets hung from the ceiling, holding burning pitch (“Asphaltus”); oily “Naphtha” was
placed in the lamps.
738–46. Hephæstus (in “Greece”), Vulcan or “Mulciber” in Italy (“Ausonian land”), was architect of the classical gods’ palaces; the story of his fall, cast out by Zeus (“angry Jove”) to land in “Lemnos” in the “Ægean”
sea, is told in Iliad 1.590–4.
Zenith. the highest point of the celestial sphere.
747 Erring. Milton thought the classical myths were erroneous versions of biblical stories.
756 Pandæmonium. Milton’s coinage, literally “all Demons,” an inversion of Pantheon, “all gods.”
768–76. Bee similes were common in epic from Homer on (Iliad 2.87–90; Aeneid 1.430–6); also, the bees’ (royalist) society was often cited in political arguments. The simile prepares for the sudden contraction of the
“common” devils, enabling them to fit into the Hall of Pandæmonium (791–2).
769. The sun is in the zodiacal sign of “Taurus” (the Bull) from about April 19 to May 20.
1. A typical epic convention (in e.g. Iliad 2.53–394, Aeneid 11.302– 446, Tasso, Gerusalemme Liberata 2.58 – 90)
involved councils debating war and peace, with spokesmen on each side. Infernal councils have
antecedents in Tasso, Vida, Valvasone, and others.
11–12. Satan is given directions by “Chaos,” the ruler (“Power”) of “that place” (Chaos) to the created universe (“new World”).
2 Ormus. Hormuz, an island port at the mouth of the Persian Gulf, famous for pearls.
4 Barbaric. Exotic; pertaining originally to all nations except Greece and Rome.
5 merit. Desert, either good or bad. Cf. 3.309–10, 6.43.
11 Powers and Dominions. Angelic orders; “vertues” (15) were also an angelic order. Milton retains the
names but not the arrangement into distinct hierarchical ranks.
28 Thunderer. The attribute of Zeus ( Jove) is the thunderbolt.
41. The classic Machiavellian choice for gaining or extending power. Tasso’s Satan (Gerusalemme Liberata, trans.
Edward Fairfax [1600], 4.16–17) also proposes “open force, or secret guile.”
40
 
90 The Vassals° of his anger, when the Scourge
90–2 Scourge . . . Penance. Suggest Roman Catholic practices of mortification.
113–14 Manna. The food supplied to the Israelites in the desert, tasting of honey. For making “the worse
appear / The better reason” Belial is aligned with the Sophists, mercenary teachers of rhetoric in ancient
Greece, who were denounced by Plato for just this practice (Apology 19b).
139 Ethereal mould. Heavenly substance, derived from “ether,” the fifth and purest element, supposed incorruptible.
148. Cf. Seneca, De Consolatione Ad Marciam 11.4–5, describing the capacity of thoughts to range through
heaven and all past and future time.
170–4. For Belial’s questions, cf. Tasso, Gerusalemme Liberata 10.44 –7. For God’s “ breath that kindled” cf.
Isa. 30:33, “the pile [of Hell] is fire and much wood; the breath of the Lord, like a stream of brimstone,
doth kindle it.” For God’s “red right hand” cf. Horace, Odes 1.2.1– 4, Jove hurling thunderbolts with a “red
right hand.”
190–1. “He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh; the Lord shall have them in derision” (Ps. 2:4). Milton’s
God is not passionless, but displays a range of emotions, see Christian Doctrine 1.2.
199–200. Echoing Mucius Scaevola’s famous words, when he held his hand in the fire to demonstrate Roman
fortitude (Livy, Ab Urbe Condita 2.12.10).
212 mind. Be concerned about; be aware of.
220 light. May be a noun, the opposite of darkness, or an adjective, “easy to bear.”
252–60. Mammon echoes the Stoic stance of Horace (Epistles 1.18.107–10) but not his proposed simple lifestyle.
278. Pain felt by the senses.
294 Michael. Traditionally, the chief of the angelic armies, cf. 6.250ff, 320ff.
306 Atlantean. Burdened statesmen were often compared to Atlas the Titan, whose rebellion Jove punished
by forcing him to bear the heavens on his shoulders.
310–11. Angelic orders. See note to line 11, above.
327–8. God’s iron scepter symbolizes Justice, his golden scepter, Mercy. Cf. Rev. 19:15, “he shall rule them
with a rod of iron.” In 1653 Milton translated Ps. 2:9 with the phrase, “ With iron scepter bruised.” See
PL 5.886–7.
349–50. Cf. Ps. 8:5: “For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels.” See PL 1.654, 8.228.
352–3. In classical epic the heavens shake when the king of the gods (Zeus, Jove) takes an oath.
369–70. Gen. 6:7, God determining to destroy the world by flood: “And the Lord said, I will destroy man
[and all the creatures] . . . for it repenteth me that I have made them.”
383. Adam is the “root” of the human family tree.
390
406 palpable obscure. Darkness so thick it can be felt (cf. Exod. 10:21).
409 vast abrupt. An abyss, referring to Chaos, the gulf between two created places, heaven and hell.
410 happy Ile. Earth, with probable allusion to the Isles of the Blessed in Greek mythology.
420. Cf. 3.217.
427–66. Cf. the Son’s parallel offer, 3.222–65.
432–3. An echo of the Sybil’s warning to Aeneas, Aeneid 6.126 – 9.
435–6. Hell’s fiery walls have nine thicknesses that “immure” the fallen angels.
Adamant. A substance
of impenetrable hardness.
441 abortive gulf. Chaos is a womb in which all potential forms fragment (cf. 900ff ).

500
506 Stygian. From the river Styx, leading to Hades.
512 Globe. A compact body, often a formation of soldiers. “Seraphim” are associated with fire; saraph in
Hebrew means “to burn.”

531 shun the Goal. To drive a chariot as close as possible to a turning post without hitting it.
533–6. The seeming appearance of warfare in the skies, reported before several notable battles including the
English Civil War, was thought to warn of the wars to come.
539–41 Typhœan rage. Typhon’s name was associated with typhoon, and meant “whirlwind.” See note to
1.198–9.
542–6 Alcides. Hercules (Alcides), wearing a poisoned (“envenom’d”) robe given to him through a deception practiced on his wife after he returned from a victory at “Oechalia,” was driven mad with pain. Wrongly
suspecting his beloved companion “Lichas,” who innocently gave him the cloak, he threw him along with
uprooted trees from the top of Mount “Oeta” in Thessaly into “the Euboic Sea,” the strait between Thessaly
in northern Greece and the Isle of Euboia. Cf. Ovid, Metamorphoses 9.134 –229.
557–65 Various classical schools are prefigured here, e.g. the Peripatetic, Epicurean, and Stoic, as well as contemporary theological debates about predestination, foreknowledge, and free will. Cf. Jesus’ denunciation
of the classical schools in Paradise Regained 4.291–321.
564 Apathie. The Stoic ideal of freedom from passion.
575–81 four infernal Rivers. These are traditional in the geography of Hell; the epithet describing each translates its Greek name.
583 Lethe. Defined here as the “River of Oblivion.” Cf. lines 74 above and 604 below.
590–1 gathers heap. In a heap, resembling the ruins of a massive old building, “ancient pile.”
592–4 Serbonian Bog. Lake Serbonis, famous for quicksands that sank armies and overwhelmed the defeated
monster Typhon, lies near the city of “Damiata” (Damietta) on the Egyptian coast near the mouth of the
Nile. “Mount Casius” lies between Egypt and Arabia.
596 harpy-footed. With eagle-like talons. In Homer the Harpies (winged monsters with women’s faces) carry
souls off to the avenging Furies (Odyssey 20.61–78). Milton combines the Harpies and the Furies.
611 Medusa. One of the three Gorgons, women with snaky hair whose look turned men to stone.
614. In Homer’s hell “Tantalus” is tormented (tantalized) by being forced to stand in the middle of a lake whose
waters recede whenever he tries to slake his raging thirst (Odyssey 11.582–92).
628 Hydras. Venomous serpents with nine heads, each of which grew back when severed. Chimeras. Firebreathing monsters.
Gorgons. See note to line 611.
629 Adversary. The literal meaning of “Satan” (see 1 Pet. 5:8).
638 Close sailing. Sailing close to the wind.
Bengala. Bengal, in India
639 Ternate and Tidore. Two of the Spice Islands, in the Moluccas (Indonesia).
640–2 Trading Flood. The trade route for spice merchants on the Indian “Ethiopian” Ocean, sailing from
the Moluccas toward “the Cape” of Good Hope and the South “Pole.”
648–9. The two figures blocking Satan’s path allude to the monster Scylla and the giant whirlpool Charybdis,
who threaten sailors passing down the Straits of Messina between Italy and Sicily (Odyssey 12.229 – 59).
The identification of the two “shapes” comes at lines 760 and 787 below.
650–61. Sin is modeled on “Scylla,” a beautiful nymph whose lower parts were changed into a ring of barking dogs when Circe, out of jealousy, poured poison into the straits between “Calabria,” the southernmost
part of Italy, and Sicily (“Trinacrian shore”) where she was bathing (Ovid, Metamorphoses 14.40–74).
Another model is Spenser’s Errour (Faerie Queene 1.1.14 –15).
655 Cerberian. Like Cerberus, the many-headed watchdog of Hades.
662–5 Night-Hag. Hecate, goddess of sorcery, whose approach is signaled by howling dogs, and who attends
orgies of witches in Lapland (famous for witchcraft), drawn by the blood of babies they have sacrificed.
666–73. The portrayal of Death as a shadowy, black, nebulous figure with dart and crown is traditional
(cf. Rev. 6:2).
692 third part. The number comes from Rev. 12:4. Cf. PL 1.632– 3 and 9.141– 2.
709–11 Ophiucus. A vast northern constellation, the Serpent Bearer. Comets were thought to predict or even
cause disasters such as “Pestilence” and “Warr”; one that appeared in this constellation in 1618 was taken
as an augury of the Thirty Years War. Cf. Tasso’s comparison of Argantes to a comet that threatens death
“To mighty lords, to monarchs, and to kings” (Gerusalemme Liberata 7.52).
714–18. Boiardo (Orlando Innamorato 1.16.10) likens Orlando and Agrican’s encounter to a clash of thunderclouds. The “Caspian” was notorious for storms.
722 foe. The Son will destroy “him that had the power of death, that is, the devil” (Heb. 2:14). He will also
destroy “the last enemy . . . death” (1 Cor. 15:26).
735
752–8. In Greek myth, Athena sprang fully armed out of the head of Zeus, an allegory, according to some
theologians, of God’s generation of the Son. Sin, Death, and Satan in their various incestuous interrelations parody obscenely the relations between God and the Son, Adam and Eve (cf. 5.602–17, 8.457– 77).
The “left” is the sinister side.
760–87. The allegorical figures of Sin and Death are based on Jas. 1:15: “Then when lust hath conceived, it
bringeth forth sin, and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.” But the incest of Sin and Death is
Milton’s own conception.
60
850
864–70. Parodies the Nicene Creed, “Jesus Christ . . . who sitteth on the right hand of the Father, and . . .
of whose kingdom there shall be no end.” Cf. PL 3.62–3, 250 – 65.
873 bestial train. Her yelping offspring.
877 wards. The ridges inside a lock, corresponding to the incisions on the key.
883 Erebus. In Greek myth, the son of Chaos. The name means darkness, and is applied to the dark space
through which the dead pass into Hades.
891–6. As a cosmic place, Chaos is infinitely extended and without any order; it surrounds the created places,
hell, heaven, the universe and it contains the primal matter out of which God creates. In Christian Doctrine
1.7, Milton argues that creation is not out of nothing but from matter originally in and then separated
from God and therefore good (cf. PL 7.168–73). As mythological figures “Chaos” and “eldest Night” are
the most ancient gods (Hesiod, Theogony 123, and Orphic Hymns 3.1–2). Milton allegorizes Chaos as embodiment of and anti-ruler (Anarch) of that place, along with Night, his consort.
898–903. These subatomic qualities combine in nature to form the four elements fire, earth, water, and air,
but in Chaos they struggle endlessly and the atoms remain unformed, embryonic. Milton’s description
owes something to Ovid, Metamorphoses 1.5–20. Atomist philosophers (e.g. Lucretius, De Rerum Natura
Book 2) saw atoms as forming the universe through endless collisions, by chance.
904 Barca . . . Cyrene. Cities in the Libyan desert.
905 Levied. Enlisted as troops, also, raised up.
poise. Add weight to.
921–2 to compare / Great things with small. A Virgilian formula (Eclogues 1.23; Georgics 4.176).
Bellona. Roman goddess of war.
939 Syrtis. The Syrtes were shifting sandbars and dangerous quicksands off the North African coast. Lucan
describes them (Pharsalia 9.303–4) as “ambiguous between sea and land.”
943–7 Gryfon. Griffins were fabulous creatures, half-eagle, half-lion, who guarded the gold of Scythia; it was
stolen from them by the one-eyed “Arimaspian” people (Herodotus, 3.116).
960–7. Chaos’s court of personifications resembles the halls of Pluto in Aeneid 6.273 – 81.
964. Latin “Orcus” and Greek “Ades” (Hades) are names of Pluto, ruler of the underworld.
965 Demogorgon. Often taken to be the most ancient and terrible of the gods, associated with Night. In Bocaccio’s
De Genealogiis Deorum he is the parent of Night and the other dark gods, Erebus, Tumult, Discord, etc.
1017–18. Jason and his companions sailed in the “Argo” through the “Bosporus” to the Black Sea, passing between
the Symplegades, or “justling Rocks.”
1019–20. Homer’s Odysseus (“Ulysses”) sailing through the Straits of Messina between Italy and Sicily avoids
the whirlpool of “Charybdis” and steers by the “other” monster, Scylla (not a whirlpool in Homer) who
devours six of his men (Odyssey 12.55–126, 222–59).
1024–32. See 10.293–305.
1050 living Saphire. Cf. Rev. 21:19.
1051. The “golden Chain” was commonly interpreted as a symbol of universal concord and divine design.
The figure appears in Iliad 8.18–27, Plato’s Theaetetus (153c–d), Spenser’s Faerie Queene 2.7.46, and in Milton’s
“Prolusion 2.”
16 Lymbo of Vanity. In Ariosto, Orlando Furioso 34., stanzas 72 – 87, the Knight Astolfo flies to the Limbo
of Vanity in the moon, to recover Orlando’s lost wits. Milton refers to that Limbo as the recent name
(“since call’d”) of the Paradise of Fools that Satan visits.
1–55. This second Proem or invocation is a hymn to Light, addressed either as the first creature of God
(“first-born,” cf. 7.243–4, where light is termed the “first of things,” and Gen.1:3) or as coeternal with God,
with allusion to 1 John 1:5, “God is Light, and in him is no darkness at all.”
4 unapproached. Cf. 1 Tim. 6:16: God dwells “in the light which no man can approach unto.”
7 hear’st thou rather. Would you rather be called (a Latinism).
Ethereal. consisting of ether, the fifth,
purest element.
11. Echoes Spenser, Faerie Queene 1.1.39, “the world of waters wide and deepe.”
12. Cf. 7.210–12, 233–4.
14 Stygian Pool. The river Styx, in the classical Hades.
17 Orphean Lyre. Orpheus, the Greek poet whose song could charm even trees and rocks, visited the underworld to win back his wife, Eurydice; one of the poems attributed to him is the so-called Orphic hymn
“To Night.” Milton’s song, Christian and epic, is of another kind, “other notes.”
19 heav’nly Muse. Urania, invoked at 1.6–16 but not named until 7.1. See note to that line.
20–1. Echoes the Sibyl’s warning to Aeneas (Aeneid 6.126– 9).
25–6. Medical terms of Milton’s day for diseases of the eyes, one of which he thinks may have caused his
blindness: “drop serene” translates gutta serena, a form of blindness in which the vision is “quencht” but
the eyes retain their clear appearance (as Milton’s did); “dim suffusion” translates suffusio nigra, a disease
in which the vision is “veild” as with cataracts.
30 Sion. The mountain of scriptural inspiration, with its “flowrie Brooks” Siloa and Kidron (in contrast with
Mount Parnassus and its stream, Helicon).
32. Milton composed chiefly at night.
35 Thamyris. A legendary Thracian poet who was punished with blindness for boasting he could sing better
than the Muses (Iliad 2.594–600).
Mæonides. Homer, said to be the son of Mæon, was often
referred to by this patronymic.
36 Tiresias. A blind Theban seer who foretold many events in the mythical history of Thebes; he also revealed
Oedipus’ guilt to him.
Phineus. Thracian king said to have been blinded by the gods for revealing
their counsels, but in the Second Defence Milton denies that his blindness was a punishment. In both, blindness and prophecy are linked.
37 voluntarie. Freely, as in a musical voluntary, added at will by the performer.
61–2. The sight of God is said to be the supreme joy of heaven, the greatest “Beatitude” (see Christian
Doctrine 1.33).
63. Cf. Heb. 1:3: “the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person.”
70
73 stoop. Descend swiftly (a term from hawking).
75 without Firmament. On the outside of the firmament (the sphere of the fixed stars that encloses the universe); also, without the shelter of any firmament.
76 Uncertain. It is not clear whether the universe floats in water or in air.
81 Transports. Conveys, moves passionately.
adversarie. The literal meaning of Satan.
84 Wide interrupt. Chaos, that forms a wide “Abyss” or gulf between Heaven and Hell; “interrupt” keeps
its Latin meaning, broken open.
94 sole Command. Not to eat of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. See Gen. 3:3, “Ye shall not eat
of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.”
96 faithless Progenie. Adam passes on to his descendants his original sin and its consequence, absence of
saving faith in God.
97–102. Milton insists that God created Adam and Eve and the angels with “sufficient” power and with reason and free will to resist evil. “The matter or object of the divine plan was that angels and men alike
should be endowed with free will, so that they could either fall or not fall” (Christian Doctrine 1.3).
108–9 Reason also is choice. For example, reason is meaningless unless it can eventuate in choices which
are free. Cf. Areopagitica, “When God gave him reason he gave him freedom to choose, for reason is but
choosing.”
111–19. Summarizes Milton’s argument in Christian Doctrine 1.3 – 4, that God does not predestine any to sin
or damnation and that his perfect foreknowledge of events does not amount to predestination; rather, he
foresees because he knows past, present, and future at once. God knows what will happen (even as humans
know what is happening or has happened) but does not cause the actions of humans or angels.
136 Spirits elect. The unfallen angels. In Christian Doctrine 1.9 Milton insists that the angels “stand by their
own strength” and are called “elect” (1 Tim. 5:21) only in the sense that they are “beloved, or excellent.”
Cf. PL 5.535–7.
140. In Christian Doctrine 1.5 Milton argues that God imparted to his Son his divine substance but not his
“whole essence,” as no two beings can have the same essence.
150–5. The Son echoes, or rather foreshadows, another mediator, Abraham, in his pleas to the Lord to spare
Sodom, “That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked . . . that be
far from thee. Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?” (Gen. 18:25).
170–2. The Son is the agent through whom God’s power, “effectual might,” is exercised (cf. l Cor. 1:24), the
“word” through whom his “wisdom” is made manifest and his creative will is performed ( John 1:1–3).
See PL 6.710–14 and 7.163–6.
174–80. After the Fall salvation is only possible through God’s grace. Reason and will are so damaged that
unless God renews them humans cannot resist sin or respond to the grace offered.
183–90. Milton’s God rejects the Calvinist doctrine that he had from the beginning predestined the damnation or salvation of each soul; rather, he associates himself with the Arminian doctrine that grace sufficient
for salvation is offered to all, enabling each person, if he or she so chooses, to believe and persevere. He does,
however, assert the right to give special grace to some, “elect above the rest.” See Christian Doctrine 1.4.
189 stonie hearts. Cf. Ezek. 11:19. “I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them an heart
of flesh.” See PL 11.1–5.
200. By at long last withdrawing his offered grace God leaves such obdurate sinners to themselves, to become
more and more hardened and blinded. See Christian Doctrine 1.8.
212 rigid satisfaction. Here and in Christian Doctrine 1.16 Milton’s God paraphrases the Anselmic theory of
the Atonement: “Satisfaction means that Christ . . . fully satisfied divine justice by fulfilling the Law and
paying the just price on behalf of all men.”
213–19. Cf. the devils in the Great Consult (2.402–26).
charitie. Heavenly love, disinterested and altruistic (Latin caritas).
236–7. Echoes Nisus’ offer to save the life of his friend Euryalus, Aeneid 9.427–8: “Me, me adsum, qui feci,
in me convertite ferrum, O Rutuli! mea fraus omnis.”
243–4. Cf. John 5:26: “For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in
himself.”
247–9. Cf. Ps. 16:10: “Thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see
corruption.”
253 mortall sting. Cf. 1 Cor. 15:55–6: “O death, where is thy sting? . . . The sting of death is sin.”
258 ruin. Throw down (the Latin sense).
259. Cf. 1 Cor. 15:26: “The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.”
286 Head of all mankind. Cf. 1 Cor. 11:3: “The head of every man is Christ.”
288–9. Cf. 1 Cor. 15:22: “For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.”
290–4. Summarizes the reformed doctrine of justification by faith. The merit of Christ attributed vicariously
(“imputed”) to humans frees from original sin those who renounce their own deeds, both good and bad,
and hope to be saved through faith.
293 transplanted. Cf. Christian Doctrine 1.21, “Of Ingrafting in Christ”: “God the Father plants believers in
Christ. That is to say, he makes them sharers in Christ.” The first effect is “new life and growth.”
297 ransomed. Cf. Matt. 20:28, “The Son of man came . . . to give his life a ransom for many.”
309. A heterodox doctrine, that the Son was Son of God by merit. In Ovid, Metamorphoses 2.42 –3 (George
Sandys’ translation), Apollo says to his son, Phaeton, “by merit, as by birth, to thee is due that name.”
Cf. PL 2.5.
320. Orders of angels.
321–2. Cf. Phil. 2:10: “At the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth,
and things under the earth.”
323–32. The description of the Last Judgment draws on several biblical texts, among them Matt. 24:30 –1
and 25:31–2, 1 Cor. 15:51–2, and 1 Thess. 4:17.
335
334–5. For the fiery destruction and new heavens and earth, see 2 Pet. 3:12–13, and Rev. 21:1.
340–1. Cf. 1 Cor. 15:28: “And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be
subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.”
351 Amarant. In Greek, unfading, a legendary immortal flower.
350–71. Milton’s heaven draws upon imagery from Rev. 4 and 22:1– 2 (thrones, harps, golden crowns, sea
of jasper, angelic hymns, pure river, tree of life); other details, e.g. the “Elisian” flowers, recall classical
descriptions of the Elysian Fields.
373. This line is a direct quote from Joshua Sylvester’s Divine Weeks and Works (1605) 1.1.45, a translation of
Du Bartas’ La Semaine (1578).
381–2. Cf. Isa. 6:2, describing the seraphim around God’s throne, “each one had six wings; with twain he
covered his face.”
383–7. Cf. Col. 1:15–16: “Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature: For by him
were all things created, that are in heaven and that are in earth.” For Milton the Son is not eternal, as in
Trinitarian doctrine, but is God’s first creation and the agent through whom he created all other beings.
Neither is he omniscient, nor omnipotent, nor immutable, nor co-equal with the Father, but participates
in those divine qualities only as the Father devolves them upon him. See Christian Doctrine 1.5.
389 ample Spirit. The power of God, not the Holy Spirit (see Christian Doctrine 1.6 ).
392 Dominations. An angelic order, standing here for all the rebel angels.
392–9. See 6.750–64, 824–92.
400
412–15. The shift to first person suggests that Milton is quoting the angels singing as a single chorus, or that
he associates himself with their song, or both.
419–22 first convex. The outermost of the ten spheres that comprise the universe. Satan “alighted ” ( both
landed, and was illumined by the dim light reflected from heaven) and “walks” on the outer shell of that
sphere.
431–9 Vultur. Vultures were said to be able to scent their prey across continents.
Imaus. Mountain
ridge extending north through Asia from modern Afghanistan to the Arctic Ocean, the regions (“ bounds”)
of the pillaging “roving Tartar.”
436. The rivers “Ganges” and “Hydaspes” (a tributary of the Indus) rise the mountains of northern India.
438–9 Sericana. A region in northwest China.
canie Waggons. Juan Gonzales de Mendoza described these
Chinese landships, made of cane or bamboo.
440–97. Milton’s Paradise of Fools (named in line 496) was inspired by Ariosto’s (less satiric) Limbo of Vanity
located in the moon (Orlando Furioso 34., stanzas 72–87; cf. PL 3.459). Milton’s region is reserved for deluded
followers of misplaced devotion, chiefly Roman Catholics.
461 Translated Saints. Holy patriarchs like Enoch (Gen. 5:24) and Elijah (2 Kgs 2:11), carried to the heavens
while yet alive.
463–5 Giants. Born of the unnatural marriages between the “sons of God ” and the daughters of men
(Gen. 6:4). See also PL 11.573–627, 683–99.
466 Babel. The tower, intended to reach heaven (Gen. 11:3 –9), became an emblem of pride and folly.
467 Sennaar. (the Vulgate form of Shinar), the plain of Babel on which the tower of “Babel” was built.
469–73 Empedocles. A Presocratic philosopher who threw himself into “Ætna” to conceal his mortality; the
volcano defeated his plan by casting up one of his sandals.
Cleombrotus. A youth who drowned himself to attain the immortality promised in Plato’s Phaedo.
474–5 Embryo’s and Idiots. Those not responsible morally, but still marked by original sin so they could
not enter heaven, were said by Catholic theologians to be held in Limbo. The “White” friars (“Friers”)
are Carmelites, the “Black” are Dominicans, and the “Grey” Franciscans.
477 Golgatha. Golgotha, “Place of the skull,” the hill where Christ was crucified. See Luke 24:5–6, “Why seek
ye the living among the dead? He is not here, but is risen.”
478–80. Some try to ensure their salvation by wearing on their deathbed the robes of various religious orders.
481–5. These souls imagine their journey through the spheres in the Ptolemaic system: the seven then known
planets, the eighth sphere of the fixed stars, then the “Crystalline Sphear” (added to the Ptolemaic system
to account for anomalies in astronomical observations). Its “ Trepidation” (oscillation or trembling), measured by Libra (the scales, “ballance”), was much disputed (“talkt”) in Milton’s time. After the tenth sphere,
the Primum Mobile (“that first mov’d”) which imparts motion to all the rest, they imagine ascent to the
empyreal Heaven.
485 Keys. Cf. Matt. 16:19: “And I will give unto thee [Peter] the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall
be loosed in heaven.” See “Lycidas,” 110.
490. The dress of the various religious orders.
492 Indulgences, Dispenses [dispensations], Pardons. Various grants set forth by the Roman Catholic Church
that could be earned or purchased to free one from the punishment due to sin, or from some religious duty.
They were seen as a scandal by the Protestant reformers. See the Pardoner’s Tale in Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales.
510–15 Jacob fled to “Padan-Aram” (in Syria) after cheating his brother “Esau” of their father’s blessing. En
route, while sleeping in the field of “Luz” (Bethel), he dreamed of a ladder reaching to heaven on which
angels ascended and descended. When he awoke he cried, “this is none other but the house of God and
this is the gate of heaven” (Gen. 28:10–17).
516 mysteriously. The episode and the ladder received numerous symbolic and allegorical interpretations.
518–19. See Rev. 4:6 (“sea of glass like unto crystal”).
521–2. Lazarus was “Wafted” by the angels to heaven (Luke 16:22); Elijah was “Rapt” (carried away) up to
heaven in a “Chariot” of fire drawn by “fiery Steeds” (“ horses of fire,” 2 Kgs 2:11).
535–7. This later opening to heaven stretched from “Paneas” (Greek name for the city of Dan) near the source
of the Jordan in the north of Canaan to “Beersaba” (Beersheba) near the Egyptian border in the south, giving God a view of the entire land of Israel (cf. 1 Kgs 4:25).
552 though after Heaven seen. i.e., “even after having seen heaven.”
557–9. In the zodiac, “Libra” in the east is diametrically opposite Aries or the Ram (“the fleecie Starr”) that
seems to carry the constellation “Andromeda” on its back in the west, in the Atlantic below the “Horizon.”
562–5 first Region. The upper air down to the Primum Mobile, the crystalline sphere and “innumerable
Starrs.”
566–71 other Worlds. The plurality of worlds was a topic of much speculation in Milton’s day (see
8.140–52). The gardens of the Hesperides and the Fortunate Isles (“happy Iles”) of Greek mythology, were
classical versions of paradise.
574–6. Satan cannot tell if he is flying up or down, or by a centric orbit that has the earth or the sun as its
center, or by an eccentric orbit that does not. Nor can he tell the distance he flew measured by degrees
(“Longitude”) along the ecliptic, the apparent orbit of the sun around the earth.
582–3. Kepler (in 1609) theorized that the sun’s magnetism caused planetary motion.
588–90. Galileo first observed sunspots through his telescope (“glaz’d Optic Tube”) in 1610.
596 Carbuncle. Any red gemstone.
Chrysolite. Any green gemstone.
597–8. In Exod. 28:15–21 “Aarons Brest-plate” is described as decorated with twelve different gems, corresponding to the twelve tribes of Israel.
598–605. Alchemists identified the philosopher’s stone with the urim on Aaron’s breastplate (Exod. 28:30);
this stone reputedly could cure all diseases, restore paradise, and transmute base metals to gold.
Alchemists would “binde” (solidify) mercury (“Volatil Hermes,” the winged god identified with that element) and dissolve, refine, or transform substances (identified with the shape-shifting god “Proteus”) to
their “Native forme” in a “Limbec” (alembic, the distilling apparatus of alchemists).
607 Elixir. The liquid form of the philosopher’s stone.
609–12. The sun’s rays were thought to penetrate the earth and produce precious metals and gems.
615–17. Before the Fall (and the consequent tipping of the earth’s axis or change in the path of the sun, see
10.668–89) shadows would disappear daily at noon at the “Æquator,” where the sun’s beams reach their
zenith (“Culminate”).
620 visual ray. The eye was thought to emit a beam onto the object perceived.
622–3. Cf. Rev. 19:17: “I saw an angel standing in the sun.”
636–7. A young “stripling” cherub not yet in the “prime” of life, or not of the first rank of angels.
648–53 Uriel. In Hebrew “Light [or fire] of God,” he is the angel named first among the seven who stood
before God’s “Throne” in the Apocryphal 1 Enoch 22:1. Zech. 4:10 states that “those seven . . . are the
eyes of the Lord, which run to and fro through the whole earth,” but Uriel is not mentioned there or anywhere else in the canonical Bible. See also Rev. 1:4.
695
695–8. Aristotle in the Nicomachean Ethics locates virtue in the mean between excess and privation, but Uriel
exempts the glorification of God from that dictum.
705–7. No creature, including the angels and even the Son, know the “secret purposes, the knowledge of
which the Father has reserved to himself alone” (Christian Doctrine 1.5)
708–20. Compare Raphael’s story of the Creation to Adam in Book 7 below.
716. The fifth element (“quintessence,” ether) of which the incorruptible heavenly bodies were made.
721 The rest. The stars that form the sphere of the fixed stars, enclosing “this Universe.”
730 triform. Refers to the moon’s phases, but also to the ancient poets’ description of the moon’s triple nature:
Luna in heaven, Diana on earth, Hecate in hell.
742 Niphates. A mountain on the border between Armenia and Assyria.
5. Cormorant. A large and voracious black sea-bird.
1–5. John of Patmos heard a cry warning of the “great dragon . . . called the Devil, and Satan” (Rev. 12:9)
when he and his angels were put to “second rout” in a second war in heaven: “Woe to the inhabiters of
the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down among you, having great wrath, because he knoweth
that he hath but a short time” (Rev. 12:12).
2 Apocalyps. Apocalypse, “unveiling,” the Greek title of the book of Revelation.
20–3. See note to lines 75–8.
27–8 Eden. The name derives from the Hebrew word for “delight.”
32–41. Milton’s nephew Edward Phillips wrote in his “Life of Milton” that these beginning lines of Satan’s
soliloquy were written several years before the poem was begun, intended then as the beginning of a tragedy
on the Fall. See Appendix A for Milton’s sketches for such a tragedy. Cf. Aeschylus’ tragedy, Prometheus
Bound, 88–112.
32–113. Compare Satan’s soliloquy with Adam’s after the Fall (10.720 – 844).
37. See John 3:20: “Every one that doeth evil hateth the light.”
43. Compare Satan’s claim at 5.857–61.
73 Me miserable! A Latinism, me miserum!
75–8. Contrast Satan’s boast at 1.254–5 and compare Marlowe’s Mephistopheles in Dr. Faustus 1.3.76, “Why,
this is hell, nor am I out of it.”
120
118 distempers. Disorders arising from an imbalance of the four humors.
132–49. Paradise (paradeisos, garden) is a delightful (“delicious”) garden in a plateau (“champain head”) on
top of a steep, densely wooded hill situated in the east of the land of Eden, between the upper Tigris and
Euphrates rivers. Cf. Spenser’s Garden of Adonis (Faerie Queene 3.6.42–5).
133–6. A Freudian reading interprets the garden as an image of the female body, with its “mound” suggestive of the mons veneris, as in Spenser’s Garden of Adonis (Faerie Queene 3.6.43).
140–2 Silvan Scene. Echoes “silvus scæna,” Aeneid 1.164. As in a Greek amphitheater, the trees are set row
on row.
155
156–9. See Orlando Furioso 34.51, Ariosto’s Paradise, where “from flowers, fruits and grass the breezes stole /
The varied perfumes.”
161 Mozambic. Mozambique, off the southeast coast of Africa, noted for its fertility.
162 Sabean. Saba, the biblical Sheba (1 Kgs 10:1–13).
163 Arabie the blest. Arabia Felix, modern Yemen (incorporating Sheba, above), and noted for the “sweet odors
of myrrh and other odoriferous plants” that waft out to sea (Diodorus Siculus, Library of History 3.44).
165 old Ocean. The Titan Oceanus.
168–71. The Apocryphal book of Tobit (chapters 6–8) tells of Tobias, “Tobits Son,” who married Sara in “Media”
and avoided the fate of her previous seven husbands (killed on their wedding night by her demon lover
“Asmodeus”) by following the instructions of the angel Raphael to burn the heart and liver of a fish,
producing a fishy smell (“fishie fume”) to drive him off. Asmodeus then fled to Egypt where Raphael
“bound” him.
193 lewd Hirelings. Base men interested only in money. Milton would have clergy support themselves, doing
away with tithes or state support. See his Considerations touching the Likeliest means to Remove Hirelings out
of the Church (1659), the condemnation of “hireling wolves” in his sonnet “To the Lord Cromwell,” and
“Lycidas,” 113–21.
194 Tree of Life. Cf. Gen. 2:9: “And out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is
pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of
knowledge of good and evil.”
209–10. Cf. Gen. 2:8: “And the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom
he had formed.”
211 Auran. The province of Haran or Hauran on the eastern border of Israel.
212–14 Great Seleucia. A powerful city on the Tigris, south of Baghdad, built by Seleucus Nicator,
Alexander the Great’s general (“Grecian Kings”) as seat of government for his Syrian empire. Called
“Great” to distinguish it from other cities with the same name, it marks the eastern boundary of Eden.
Telassar. The ancient name of Seleucia, mentioned in the Old Testament twice as a place where the Assyrians
destroyed “the Children of Eden” (2 Kgs 19:12 and Isa. 37:12).
221–2. See Christian Doctrine 1.10: “It was called the tree of knowledge of good and evil from the event, for
since it was tasted, not only do we know evil, but we do not even know good except through evil.”
223 a River large. The Tigris, identified at 9.71.
229–35. Cf. Gen. 2:10: “a river went out of Eden to water the garden: and from thence it was parted, and
became into four heads.”
239 mazie error. Meandering as in a maze (“error” here keeps its Latin sense, errare, wandering).
242 curious Knots. Flower beds laid out in intricate regular designs, associated with Tudor garden art.
boon. Bountiful.
247 seat. Like a country estate, with a variety of prospects (“various view”).
250–1 Hesperian Fables. By contrast to the feigned golden apples of the Hesperides (fabled paradisal islands
in the Western Ocean) Eden has “true” golden apples.
266–7 Universal Pan. The wood-god “Pan” was taken as a symbol of “Universal” nature since his name in
Greek means “all.”
Graces. Euphrosyne, Aglaia, and Thalia attend upon Venus, as in Botticelli’s
Primavera.
Hours. Horae, goddesses of the seasons. See Milton’s “L’Allegro,” 11–24, and Comus 986.
268–84. Even as he denies the comparison Milton associates Eden with four famous beauty spots of classical myth.
268–72. Enna. A lovely meadow in Sicily from which “Proserpin” was kidnapped by “gloomie Dis” (Pluto);
her mother “Ceres” sought her throughout the world.
272–5 Grove / Of Daphne. A laurel grove on the river “Orontes” in Syria, whose “inspir’d/Castalian Spring”
was named for the Muses’ fountain near Parnassus and was said to bestow prophetic powers.
280
275–9 Nyseian Ile. Nysa in the river “Triton” in Tunisia was where “Ammon,” an Egyptian god, identified
with Jupiter (“Jove”) and with Noah’s son “Cham” (Ham) hid the nymph “Amalthea” and his child by her,
“Bacchus,” from his wife “Rhea.”
280–4 Mount Amara. At the source of the Nile (“Nilus head”) at the Equator (“Ethiop Line”), in splendid
palaces amid paradisal gardens, the “Abassin” (Abyssinian) kings kept their sons (“issue”) to avoid sedition.
Peter Heylyn, in his Cosmographie (1652), said it was “a dayes journey high,” and that “some have taken
(but mistaken) it for the place of Paradise” (4.64).
301 Hyacinthin. Curled. Cf. Odysseus’ hair that “hung down like hyacinthine petals” shining like “gold on
silver” (Odyssey 6.231–2).
302–8. See 1 Cor. 11:14–15: “if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him . . . But if a woman have long
hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering.” The AV glosses “covering” to indicate
that “she is under the power of her husband.” Royalists were often derided by Puritans for their long hair.
Compare Eve’s “Disheveld” and “wanton” ringlets to nature in Eden (4.236 – 43).
102
344. See Isa. 11:6: “The leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling
together.”
348 Insinuating. moving sinuously, twisting.
Gordian twine. cords as convoluted as the Gordian knot
which Alexander the Great had to cut with his sword.
361–5. See Ps. 8:5: “For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory
and honour.”
383 Kings. Cf. Isaiah’s prophecy of the fall of Babylon (Isa. 14:9) promising to stir up to “meet thee at thy
coming . . . all the chief ones of the earth . . . all the kings of the nations.” The reference suggests that
Hell is (and will be) populated by kings. Some of the fallen angels bear monarchical titles: Princedoms,
Dominations, Thrones, etc.
389–94. Satan is cast as a Machiavellian politician and tyrant, appealing to reason of state (“public reason”),
“Honour and Empire,” and “necessitie, / The Tyrants plea” to justify evil deeds.
402–8. When Satan inhabits them, the future predators foreshadow their natures after the Fall. couchant.
Lying close to the ground, ready to pounce.
420
423–7. See Gen. 2:16–17: “Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: But of the tree of the knowledge
of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.”
430–2. See Gen. 1:26: “And God said, Let us make man in our image . . . and let them have dominion over
the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle . . . , and over every creeping thing
that creepeth upon the earth.”
443 Head. Cf. 1 Cor. 11:3: “the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the
head of Christ is God.”
447 by so much odds. By such a large difference.
449–91. Compare Adam’s account of his creation and marriage to Eve (8.250 –520).
456–76. Eve’s experience parallels, with significant differences, the story of Narcissus, who fell in love with
his own reflection and pined away; he was then transformed into the flower bearing his name (Ovid,
Metamorphoses 3.402–510).
475 Mother of human Race. Cf. Gen. 3:20, “Adam called his wife’s name Eve, because she was the mother
of all the living.”
490
499–501. In Iliad 14.346–51 Zeus (“Jupiter”), god of the sky, and Hera (“Juno”), goddess of the air, make love
under a cloud; their union was sometimes allegorized as a union of aether and air. Milton’s Jupiter impregnates the clouds with the seeds of flowers that grow after rain.
544–5 Alablaster. White, translucent marble veined with colors.
549 Gabriel. Hebrew, “Strength of God.” A tradition (see 1 Enoch 20:7) gave Gabriel charge of Paradise.
557–61 thwarts. Passes over, obstructs.
vapors fir’d. Combustible exhalations from the earth,
thought to cause shooting stars, which would foretell storms, “Impetuous winds.”
565
592–5. Here and elsewhere Milton describes the cosmos in both Ptolemaic and Copernican terms.
110
641–56. This embedded love lyric, replete with striking rhetorical figures of circularity and repetition, displays Eve’s poetic talents. It is constructed as an epanalepsis, a figure which begins and ends with the same
word (“Sweet / sweet”) after intervening matter.
670–3 Temper. Heal or refresh by restoring the proper balance of elements or humors. The stars were thought
to have their own occult influence, and also to moderate that of the sun.
688 Divide the night. Mark the watches of the night; also, perform musical divisions, elaborate melodic
passages.
691 sovran Planter. See Gen. 2:8: “God planted a garden eastward in Eden.”
707–8. Forest and field deities of classical mythology. “Pan,” “Silvanus,” and “Faunus” were fertility gods, halfman, half-goat.
711 Hymenæan. Wedding song. Hymen was the classical god of marriage.
714–19 Pandora. Pandora (Greek, “all gifts”) was an artificial woman, molded of clay, bestowed by the gods
on Epimetheus (“afterthought”), brother of Prometheus (“forethought”), who angered the gods by stealing Jove’s fire for man. She brought a box that foolish Epimetheus (“the unwiser Son / Of Japhet”) opened,
releasing all the ills of the human race, leaving only hope trapped inside. The brothers were sons of the
Titan Iapetos, who was often identified with Japhet, the third son of Noah. The Eve–Pandora parallel was
often noted.
724–5. See Ps. 74:16: “The day is thine, the night also is thine: thou hast prepared the light and the sun.”
736–8 Rites. Like many Puritans, Milton objected to set forms of prayer, so Adam and Eve pray spontaneously, therefore sincerely, though paradoxically they pray together, “unanimous.”
744–9. 1 Tim. 4:1–3, applied by Protestants to the Roman Church, warns that “in the latter times some shall
depart from the faith . . . Forbidding to marry.” Cf. 1 Cor. 7:9, “ But if they cannot contain, let them marry:
for it is better to marry than to burn,” and Gen. 1:28: “And God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.”
750–75. An embedded epithalamium (wedding song originally sung outside the bridal chamber). The Bard
takes on the role of celebrator singing outside Adam and Eve’s bower as they prepare for sex and sleep,
though this couple’s wedding night took place at some earlier time.
761. Cf. Heb. 13:4: “Marriage is honourable in all, and the bed undefiled.”
762 Saints and Patriarchs. Many of them were married.
763. The “golden shafts” (arrows) of Cupid (Love) were said to produce true love; his lead-tipped arrows, hate.
768 Mixt Dance. Men and women dancing together.
wanton Mask. The ostentatious entertainments
of the Stuart court.
769–70 Serenate. Milton imagines a Petrarchan serenade (night song) by a lover perishing from the cold
(“starv’d”) his “proud” lady exudes by her refusals of love (a typical Petrarchan conceit).
776–7. The conical shadow cast by the earth has moved “Half way up Hill,” i.e., halfway between the horizon and the zenith, so it is 9 p.m.
778 Ivorie Port. The source of false dreams in Homer (Odyssey 6.562 – 5), dreams whose message is never
accomplished.
782 Uzziel. Hebrew, “Strength of God.” Cabbalistic tradition identified him as one of the seven angels before
God’s throne.
788 Ithuriel. Hebrew, “Discovery of God.”
Zephon. Hebrew, “ Look-out.” There is no biblical account
of angels so named.
802 Organs. Instruments.
Fancie. The faculty that forms mental images.
805 animal Spirits. The highest of the three kinds of fine vapors produced in the human body: ascending
from the blood to the brain, they convey sense data from past experiences, and issue through nerves to
impart motion to the body.
812 Celestial temper. Ithuriel’s spear “tempered” (prepared ) in celestial ether.
885
896 object. Put forward as an objection.
904–5 O loss. Irony, i.e., O what a loss to Heaven to lose such a judge of wisdom as Satan, whose folly led
to his downfall.
925
940 mid Aire. Satan will become “prince of the power of the air” (Eph. 2:2).
945 cringe. Satan contemptuously parallels the angels’ courtly deference, keeping various “distances” before
God’s throne, with keeping a safe distance from battle.
120
997–8 golden Scales. The constellation Libra (the Scales) is between Virgo (identified with “Astraea,” goddess of Justice, who fled the earth at the end of the Golden Age) and Scorpio.
1002–3. In several classical epic similes the fates of opposing heroes are weighed in scales by the gods:
cf. Iliad 8.69–72, where the destiny of the Greeks is weighed against that of the Trojans, and Virgil, Aeneid
12.725–7, where Aeneas’ fate is weighed against that of Turnus. See also Isa. 40:12: God “hath measured
the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust
of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance.”
1004 kickt the beam. i.e., of the scales: the battle desired by Satan proved lighter.
1012. See Dan. 5:27, God’s warning to King Belshazzar, “Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found
wanting.”
13 diswades. To advise or exhort (a person) against.
1–2. Cf. the Homeric descriptive formula, “rosy-fingered dawn” (Iliad 1.477).
3–4. Cf. 9.1049–52.
6. Rustling leaves and foaming streams (“fuming rills”) are stirred by the morning breezes (“fan”) of “Aurora,”
goddess of the dawn.
16 Zephyrus. God of the west wind.
Flora. Goddess of flowers. They were consorts in Ovid, Fasti 5.197–207.
Cf. Botticelli, Primavera.
95
100–13. Adam’s explanation of the dream summarizes the orthodox faculty psychology and dream theory
of Milton’s time, a knowledge unfallen man possesses. “Fansie” (fancy) forms images of the “external things”
the “five watchful Senses” present; “Reason” connects or separates those images, producing “knowledge
or opinion.” In sleep, reason withdraws and fancy takes over, “misjoyning shapes” and mismatching “words
and deeds” from past experience, in “dreams.”
117 God. Probably angel, as elsewhere, but perhaps also God, whose omniscience includes knowledge of evil.
135
140 wheels. Helios, or Sol, god of the sun, was imagined to drive the chariot of the sun from east to west.
146–52 various style. Adam and Eve employ many forms of speech and song that harmonize together in
“fit strains” but are at the same time spontaneous and ecstatic, expressing “holy rapture.” Milton, like other
Puritans, disapproved of set liturgical forms.
153–208. Their morning hymn works variations on Psalms 148, 104, and 19, as well as the canticle Benedicite.
166–8. Venus, the morning star, is the last star to disappear at dawn and (as Hesperus) the first to appear in
the evening.
176–8 Orb that flies. The orb of the “fixt Starrs” revolves, though the stars remain “fixt” in place.
five other wandring Fires. The other planets besides the moon and sun, already mentioned, are Mercury,
Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and Venus (or earth), which change positions. These motions produce the music of
the spheres, audible to unfallen humans.
180–3. The four elements – earth, water, air, fire – are the “eldest birth” of nature, and “nourish” all things
by their “ceasless change” and orderly interactions.
205
215–19. A familiar emblem of matrimony, the “Elm,” symbolizing masculine strength, and the “Vine,” feminine fruitfulness, softness, and sweetness. But “adopted Clusters” seems to carry matriarchal implications.
221–3 Raphael. In Hebrew, “Health of God.” He was the advisor of “Tobias” in winning his wife (see 4.168–71
and note), and told him how to cure Tobit’s blindness (Apocrypha: Tobit 11:7–14). In cabbalism he is one
of the four angels (with Gabriel, Michael, and Uriel) in charge of the four corners of the earth.
229–30. God spoke to Moses, “face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend” (Exod. 33:11).
249 Ardors. Spirits (angels) burning in love, from the Latin ardere, “to burn.”
261–3 Galileo. Cf. 1.288–91.
264–6 Cyclades. A circular group of islands in the south Aegean sea. The two islands a “Pilot” might see as
“spots” from within the archipelago are “Delos” (the traditional center but famous for having floated adrift)
and “Samos,” outside the group, off the coast of Asia Minor.
266–76. Raphael’s descent is an epic topos, modeled on the descents of Virgil’s Mercury (Aeneid 4.238 – 58)
and Tasso’s Michael (Gerusalemme Liberata 9.60–2).
272 Phœnix. A mythical, unique bird (“sole”) who lived five hundred years, was consumed by fire, and was
reborn from the ashes which it then carried to the Temple of the Sun at Heliopolis in Egypt (“Ægyptian
Theb’s”).
276–85 proper shape. Modeled on the description of the Seraphim in Isa. 6:2; “each one had six wings; with
twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly.”
285 Maia’s son. Mercury, messenger of the gods.
293 Cassia. A cinnamon.
Nard. Spikenard.
Balme. Balsam. All were used to make perfumed
ointments.
299–300. Raphael’s visit to Adam is modeled on Abraham’s entertainment of three angels: “[Abraham] sat
in the tent door in the heat of the day; And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by
him.” He and his wife Sarah prepared a meal for the angels, but most Christian commentators agreed that
these angels, being spirits, ate only in show (Gen. 18:1– 8).
304–7. Eve prepared sweet drinks (“nectarous draughts”) from juices (“milkie stream”) of “Berrie or Grape,”
to be enjoyed “between” courses of “savourie fruits.”
322 small store. Reserve.
store. Abundance.
339–41 middle shoare. “Pontus,” the south coast of the Black Sea, was famous for nuts and fruits; the “Punic”
(Carthaginian) coast of North Africa on the Mediterranean, was famous for figs; the garden of Alcinous
in the mythical island of Scheria is described in Odyssey 7.113 – 28 as perpetually fruitful.
345 inoffensive moust. Unfermented grape juice.
meathes. Meads, honey-sweetened drinks.
349 unfum’d. Naturally scented, not needing to be burned as incense.
354–7 tedious pomp. The showy display of kings like Charles II whose pageantry “Dazles the croud” but
falls far short of the “solemn” natural majesty of Adam.
371 Vertue. One of the traditional nine orders of angels in the scheme of Dionysius the Areopagite:
Seraphim, Cherubim, Thrones, Dominions, Virtues, Powers, Principalities, Archangels, Angels. Milton uses
these titles freely, in the Protestant manner, without regard to this hierarchical order. Some angels are
given more than one title: Raphael is called “Vertue” here, “Seraph” at line 277, and “Arch-Angel” at 7.41.
378 Pomona. Roman goddess of fruit trees.
381–2 three. On “Mount Ida,” Venus, Juno, and Minerva “naked strove” for the apple of discord inscribed
“for the fairest.” Paris awarded the prize to Aphrodite (“the fairest Goddess”) in return for the love of
Helen, which led to her rape and the Trojan War.
385–8. Cf. the angel’s words to Mary announcing that she would bear a son, Jesus (Luke 1:28): “Hail, thou
that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women.” For Mary as “second Eve”
see PL 10.183.
398–400 our Nourisher. Cf. Jas. 1:17, “Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh
down from the Father of lights.”
404–500. Raphael’s discourse and dialogue about the nature of things recall Lucretius’ De Rerum Natura
(“Of the Nature of Things”), often termed a philosophic epic; Raphael chooses a brief version of that genre
for his exposition.
404–13. As a monist who believed that all creation is of “one first matter” (472; see also Christian Doctrine
1.7), Milton denied the more common (dualistic) idea that angels are pure spirits (who would not eat or
have any experiences pertaining to the senses); he held instead that angels are of a very highly refined
material substance .
412 concoct, digest, assimilate. The three stages of digestion.
414–26 The grosser feeds the purer. That all features of the natural world require sustenance from creatures below them in the scale of being was a commonplace (Cf. Pliny, Natural History 2.9). Robert Fludd,
Utriusque cosmi historia (1617), has an engraving that shows the sun supping with the ocean (1.5 – 6).
418–20 spots. Raphael describes moonspots as undigested vapors not yet assimilated to the moon’s substance.
Cf. 1.287–91, where those spots are described in Galileo’s terms as features of the moon’s landscape.
427–30. “Nectar” and “ambrosia” are the drink and food of the classical gods; Milton adds “pearly grain,”
like the manna showered on the Israelites in the desert (Cf. Exod. 16:14).
435 in mist. The usual explanation (“common gloss”) of orthodox theologians was that when angels
appeared to humans they took bodies of air. See lines 299 – 300 above, and note.
438 transubstantiate. In common theological use, the Roman Catholic doctrine that the bread and wine of
the eucharist are in their substance transformed into the body and blood of Christ. Milton vigorously denied
that doctrine, describing as a true transubstantiation the angels’ transformation of earthly food into their
more highly refined substance. The residue (“what redounds”) passes out as vapor through the pores (“transpires”) – the angelic form of excretion.
446–8 Sons of God. A patristic tradition identifies them with angels (as here) though they are usually said
to be human sons of Seth, as in 11.621–2. Gen. 6:2 tells of their marriage to the daughters of men.
469–79. Milton held that the universe was created out of Chaos, not out of nothing (ex nihilo), the orthodox
position. The primal matter of Chaos had its origin in God, who subsequently created all things from that
matter (see 7.168–73). This materialist monism denies sharp distinctions between angels and men, spirit
and matter, all being of one substance with different degrees of refinement. The universe Raphael
describes is hierarchical but also dynamic and striving, as beings become increasingly spiritual (“spiritous”)
or increasingly gross depending on their moral choices (see Christian Doctrine 1.7).
479–87. The plant figure provides an illustration of the dynamism of being in Milton’s universe, and further
explains why Raphael can eat the fruit. That fruit is transformed into various orders of “spirits”: “vital,”
fluids in the blood sustaining life; “animal,” produced from the vital spirits and controlling sensation and
motion; and “intellectual,” spirits controlling the faculties of the soul – fancy, understanding, and reason.
The soul derives her being from the spirits and so is material.
483 sublim’d. Raised to a higher state, an alchemical term referring to the change of a solid into a gas.
488–90 Discursive, or Intuitive. According to the traditional dualist assumption, angels are pure spirits whose
intuition (immediate apprehension of truth) is absolutely distinct from human reason (which involved combining data and arguing from premises to conclusions). Milton makes the distinction only relative,
“Differing but in degree.”
498–501. Cf. 7.157–61.
509 scale of Nature. The “Chain of Being” extending from God down to the lowest element of creation
(see, e.g., Macrobius, In Somnium Scipionis 1.14.15).
520–43. Cf. 3.93–128.
557 Worthy of Sacred silence. Translates Horace, Odes 2.13.29, referring to songs sung by Alcaeus and Sappho
in Hades; their words are “sacro digna silentio.”
563 High matter. Raphael’s account of the war in Heaven is an epic device, a narrative of past action; it is
also a mini-epic itself, with traditional battles, challenges, and single combats. As an “epic” poet treating
sacred matter, Raphael confronts a narrative challenge similar to Milton’s own.
571–6. Raphael first explains his narrative strategy in terms of the traditional notion of “accommodation,”
couching spiritual matters in “corporal” terms that humans can understand; but he then extends the Platonic
idea that earth is a shadow of heaven (Republic 10.397B –598D) to suggest that the two realms are more
similar than earthly thinkers have supposed.
580–2. Countering a long philosophical tradition, Milton asserts the existance of time and motion in Heaven,
before the creation of the universe (see Christian Doctrine 1.7).
583 great Year. The cycle completed when all the heavenly bodies simultaneously return to their original
positions (see, e.g., Plato, Timaeus 39d). A common estimate of that cycle was 36,000 earth years.
589 Gonfalons. Flags hung from a crossbar.
Van. Vanguard.
603–5: Cf. Ps. 2:7: “I will declare the decree . . . Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.” This
episode refers to the exaltation of the Son as King, not his actual begetting, since he is elsewhere described
as “of all Creation first” (3.383), and as God’s agent in creating the angels and everything else (5.835 – 8).
606. Cf. Col. 2:10: “Ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power.”
607–8 by my Self have sworn. At Gen. 22:16, God swears by himself to bless Abraham. See Phil. 2:9 –11:
“God also hath highly exalted him . . . That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven,
and things in earth, and things under the earth” (cf. Isa. 45:23).
620–7 Mystical dance. The “intricate” dance of the angels produces “harmonie Divine,” like the “intricate”
movements of the stars and the planets in both circular and noncircular (“Eccentric”) orbits that produce
the music of the spheres according to the Pythagorean theory.
658–9 former name. Traditionally understood to be Lucifer: “How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer,
son of the morning” (Isa. 14:12). The poem claims that his former name was blotted from the books of
life (see PL 1.361–5).
664 Messiah. In Hebrew the name means “anointed.”
671 next subordinate. His original name in Heaven is also lost, but he will come to be known as Beelzebub
(2.299–300).
673 Sleepst thou. In many epics a voice awakens heroes or villains from sleep and lures them to rash or
adventurous acts.
689 North. The traditional site of Lucifer’s throne. See Isa. 14:13: “I will exalt my throne above the stars of
God . . . in the sides of the north.”
708 Morning Starr. An allusion to Satan as Lucifer, compared to the star Venus or Hesperus which bore the
name Lucifer when it appeared as the first star in the morning (see notes to lines 166 and 658 above).
710 third part. Cf. Rev. 12:4: “And his [the dragon’s] tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did
cast them to the earth.”
735–7. Cf. Ps. 2:4: “He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in derision.”
741 dextrous. Skillful, but also with the Latin meaning of “right hand,” in reference to the Son at God’s right
hand (606 above).
750. See note to line 371, above.
766 Mountain of the Congregation. Cf. Isa. 14:13–14, where Lucifer is quoted, “I will sit also upon the mount
of the congregation, in the sides of the north: . . . I will be like the most High.”
787–802. Compare Milton’s republican theory, stated in the Tenure of Kings and Magistrates: “No man who
knows ought, can be so stupid to deny that all men naturally were borne free, being the image and resemblance of God himself, and were by privilege above all the creatures, born to command and not to obey:
and that they liv’d so” (until Adam’s sin necessitated magistrates and laws, though sovereign power always
remained with the people). Cf. Adam’s natural republicanism, when learning of the first king, Nimrod
(PL 12.64–71).
805 Abdiel. Hebrew, “Servant of God.”
811 ingrate. Cf. 3.97.
822–5. Cf. Rom. 9:20: “O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him
that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus?”
833–40. Cf. Col. 1:16: “For by him [the Son, the image of God] were all things created, that are in heaven,
and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities,
or powers, all things were created by him, and for him.” Milton believed that God created the Son “the
firstborn of every creature” (Col. 1:15), who then created the angels; as Abdiel argues, there can be no
equality between Creator and creature.
843 reduc’t. Suggests something like an incarnation of the Son for the angels.
856–9. Cf. 8.250–1, 276–82, Adam’s comment on his recollection of origins; also cf. 4.43– 5.
875 Seraph. Hebrew, “to burn.”
882–8. Abdiel speaks as an inspired prophet.
887 Iron Rod. See 2.327–8 and note.
889–93. Cf. Moses’ warning to the Israelites not to join Korah’s rebellion: “Depart, I pray you, from the tents
of these wicked men . . . lest ye be consumed in all their sins” (Num. 16:26). Cf. also Heb. 12:29: “For our
God is a consuming fire.”
3 devilish Engines. Artillery, cannon.
2–3 Morn. Aurora, goddess of the dawn.
Hours. daughters of Jove who control the seasons and guard
the gates of Heaven.
rosie hand. echoes the Homeric formula “rosy-fingered dawn” (Iliad 1.477).
4–14. Hesiod’s cave in the abyss where Night and Day alternate (Theogony 744 – 57), here relocated “fast by”
(next to) God’s throne.
25
29–30 Servant of God. Literal translation of the Hebrew name Abdiel. Echoes the parable of the talents
(Matt. 25:21), “Well done, thou good and faithful servant.”
better fight. Cf. 1 Tim. 6:12, “Fight
the good fight of faith.”
42 Right reason. True, upright reason, translating the Stoic and Scholastic recta ratio.
43 by right of merit. See 3.309 and 2.5–6.
44 Michael. Hebrew, “Who is like God”; in Jewish and patristic tradition he is prince of the angels. Cf. Rev.
12:7–9 for his role in the battle in Heaven.
46 Gabriel. Hebrew, “Strength of God.”
49 Equal in number. As one-third of the angels rebelled, God sends out only an equal number of those who
remained loyal.
64–6 instrumental Harmonie. Cf. 1.549–53, where the fallen angels march to music by flutes and recorders
in the Dorian mode, also prompting to heroic action.
73–6. Similes comparing armies to birds are epic commonplaces (cf. Iliad 2.459 – 64, Aeneid 7.699 –701), but
Raphael adapts his simile to Adam’s experience (cf. PL 8.349 –54).
130
145–8 dissent. Puritans who refused to adhere to the national church after the Restoration were termed
dissenters.
Sect. A term used by adherents of the Church of England and by Presbyterians to smear
those who separated from the national church. Abdiel’s terms align him with those Puritan schismatics –
Baptists, Quakers, Socinians, and others – whom Milton often defended in his prose tracts; like them Abdiel
claims that truth may reside with a single “dissenter” or sect of a few.
152–6 seditious. Treasonous. Satan’s language aligns him with those Anglicans after the Restoration who
denounced dissenters as traitors, with Presbyterians who look to a “Synod” (a Presbyterian assembly) to
define truth, and with conformists of all stripes who think truth is confirmed by numbers (“A third part
of the Gods”).
163 Unanswerd least thou boast. i.e., lest you boast that I did not answer your argument.
167–9 Ministring. Satan’s contemptuous pun links the angels’ service (“ministring”), which he terms
“Servilitie,” with the street songs of minstrels (“Minstrelsie of Heav’n”).
174–81 Nature. Abdiel cites a “natural law” principle set forth by Aristotle and by Milton in the Second Defense,
that when one man excels all the rest in worthiness he should rule.
178–81 servitude. See 12.90–101. Milton often invoked the principle that tyrants are enslaved to their own
passions.
183–4. Cf. Satan’s words at 1.263.
196 Winds under ground. The supposed cause of earthquakes.
199 Rebel Thrones. Here as elsewhere Milton uses the name of one angelic order to stand for all. But the
term is politically suggestive, linking monarchs with rebellion against God. Cf. 12.36, Michael’s comment
that the first king, Nimrod, derived his name from “Rebellion.”
232–5. i.e., they had leaders, yet each single warrior seemed like a commander-in-chief, skilled in all military
operations.
254–5 rockie Orb. Satan’s “ample Shield” made of “tenfold Adamant,” a mythical impenetrable substance
imagined as folded ten times in thickness. Cf. 542–3 below.
158
310–15 to set forth / Great things by small. A Virgilian formula, here introducing an epic simile comparing the single combat of Satan and Michael (“great things”) with war among the planets (“small” by comparison), prompted by the clash of two planets from opposed positions causing a “malign” influence and
throwing into discord the music of the spheres (“jarring Sphears”).
330–3 Nectarous humor. The fluid angels bleed because they drink nectar; cf. the ichor that flows from
Aphrodite’s wound, which also heals itself promptly (Iliad 5.339 – 42).
Sanguin. Blood red.
350–3. Cf. 1.423–31.
limb themselves. Provide themselves with limbs, dense or aery.
355–6 might of Gabriel. Mighty Gabriel (Homeric diction).
Ensignes. Banners, which identify the
several divisions of troops.
array. Thick rows of troops.
365. Adramelec. King of fire, the Babylonian sun god worshiped in Samaria with human sacrifice (2 Kgs 17:31).
Asmadai. Asmodeus, creature of judgment, the evil spirit of the Apocryphal book of Tobit (see PL 4.168).
371–2 Ariel. “Lion of God.”
Arioc. “Lion-like.”
Ramiel. “Thunder of God,” one of the angels
fornicating with women in 1 Enoch 6:7. All three names are used of good and bad angels in rabbinical
and demonological texts.
420
416. Nocturnal councils called by an army defeated in a battle are common in epic.
441–2 made the odds. Gave them the advantage, since “Nature” gives them none.
447 Nisroc. An Assyrian god worshiped by Sennacherib (2 Kgs 19:36 –7). His Hebrew name means “flight.”
468. i.e., We would owe such a one our deliverance.
477–82 spiritous and fiery spume. See below, lines 511–12, “Sulphurous and Nitrous Foame”; these “dark
and crude” materials touched by “Heav’ns ray” become all the “beauteous” features of Heaven’s landscape (474–5). Satan proposes to mine these elements in their “dark Nativitie.”
485–6 Thick-rammd. Compactly packed.
bore. The touch-hole into which gunpowder is poured to
serve as fuse for the charge.
Dilated and infuriate. Exploding violently. Cannon and gunpowder
were often described as originating in hell.
493. i.e., we will achieve (“effect”) our “wish.”
515 blackest grain. Gunpowder; its ingredients are saltpeter and sulphur (512).
516–20 Part. Some of them cast (“found”) cannon and cannonballs (“Engins” and “Balls”) sending a message
of destruction (“missive ruin”), with a play on missile.
part. Some “Provide” the kindling (“incentive reed”) to ignite (“fire”) the cannon.
165
560–7. The passage is full of puns, e.g., “Peace” (and piece, a weapon); “composure” (settlement of disputes
and construction [of weapons]); “brest” (heart/the forward line of a military formation); “overture” (offer
to negotiate/opening, the bore of the cannon); “discharge . . . charge” (perform our duty/fire our explosives); “appointed” (chosen/equipped); “touch” (state/ignite, touch off ); “propound” (propose/crush by
beating).
576–90. These lines contain numerous debased puns relating to bodily functions, e.g., “mouthes,” “orifice,”
“behind,” “narrow vent,” “deep throated,” “belcht,” “Emboweld,” “entrails,” “disgorging,” “glut,” “Iron
Globes.”
589 chaind Thunderbolts. Chain shot, cannonballs linked together.
611–12. More puns: “entertain” (welcome/engage an enemy); “open Front” (candid face/front rank of troops);
“Brest” (heart/forward line of a military company).
613 composition. Another pun (truce/composition of gunpowder).
621–7. Belial puns on “terms of weight” (solid negotiating terms/heavy cannonballs); “amus’d” (held their
attention/bewildered them); “stumbl’d” (nonplussed/tripped up); “understand” (comprehend/support); “walk
not upright” (deal dishonestly/cannot stand on their feet).
643–6. The hurling of “Hills” as missiles is taken from the war between the Olympian gods and the Titans
in Hesiod’s Theogony 713–20.
680–2 Effulgence. Radiance. cf. Heb. 1:3, describing the Son as “the brightness of his glory and the express
image of his person.”
invisible. Cf. Col. 1:15, “Who is the image of the invisible God.”
684 Second Omnipotence. Two omnipotences are a logical impossibility. Cf. John 5:19, “The Son can do
nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do,” a text Milton cites in Christian Doctrine 1.5, to argue
that the Son derives all power from the Father.
728–9. Cf. Matt. 3:17, “my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.”
731–3. Cf. 1 Cor. 15:24, 28: “Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God . . .
then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in
all” (See PL 3.339–41).
739 undying Worm. Cf. Mark 9:44: “[Hell is] Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.”
750–61 Chariot of Paternal Deitie. The Son’s living chariot, with its four-faced Cherubim – the faces being
man, lion, ox (or cherub), and eagle – is taken from Ezek. 1 and 10. See especially 10:12, “And their whole
body, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes round about,
even the wheels that they four had.”
751 Undrawn. Moving by its own power.
761 Urim. Gems worn by the high priest Aaron on his breastplate of judgment (Exod. 28:30).
762–4 Victorie. Milton’s personification is based on Nike, the winged Greek goddess of victory, and on Jove’s
bird, the eagle.
three-bolted Thunder. Jove’s weapon is the three-forked thunderbolt.
769–72 Chariots of God. Cf. Ps. 68:17, “The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands of angels:
the Lord is among them.”
wings of Cherub. Cf. Ps. 18:10, “And he rode upon a cherub.”
Saphir Thron’d. Cf. Ezek. 1:26, “the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone.”
801–11 Stand still. Echoes Moses’ words when God destroyed the Egyptians in the Red Sea (Exod. 14:13):
“Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of the Lord which he will shew to you to day.”
808 Vengeance is his. Cf. Rom. 12:19, “Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.”
815 Kingdom and Power and Glorie. Cf. Matt. 6:13, “For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the
glory, for ever.”
827 the Four. The Four “Cherubic shapes” of line 753.
842–3 Mountains . . . shelter. Cf. Rev. 6:16, the cry of the damned to the mountains, “Fall on us, and hide
us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb.”
845. See lines 753 and 827.
853. Cf. Hesiod’s Zeus, who put forth all his strength against the Titans (Theogony 687–9).
856–7 Heard / Of Goats. In the parable of the sheep and the goats, the latter were sent “into everlasting
fire, prepared for the devil and his angels” (Matt. 25:33, 41).
871. In Hesiod’s Theogony (720–5) the Titans fell nine days from heaven to earth, and nine more days from
earth to Tartarus.
1–39. The third invocation or proem.
1 Descend from Heav’n. Echoes Horace’s invocation of the Muse Calliope, “Descende caelo” (Odes 3.4.1).
Urania. The classical Muse of astronomy who had been made into the Muse of Christian poetry by
Du Bartas and other religious poets (“Urania” means “heavenly”). Milton constructs another derivation for
her (5–12).
3 Olympian Hill. Mount Olympus, the home of the classical gods and Muses.
4 Pegasean. Pegasus, the winged horse of inspired poetry, had created the Muses’ spring, Hippocrene; he is
associated with Bellerophon (18–20 below, and note).
9–12 Eternal Wisdom. In Prov. 8:22–31 Wisdom tells of her activities before the Creation. “Then I was by
him [God], as one brought up with him: and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him.” Milton
devises a myth in which that “Wisdom” which is a personification of God’s wisdom is the “Sister” of Urania
as the Muse of divine poetry (“Celestial Song,” line 12); therefore, Urania also originates from God.
18–20 Bellerophon. He incurred the gods’ anger when he tried to fly to heaven on Pegasus. Zeus sent a gadfly
to sting the horse, and Bellerophon fell down to the “Aleian Field,” where he wandered “Erroneous” (translates “Aleian,” Greek for wandering), alone (“forlorne”), and in some accounts blind.
22 Diurnal Spheare. The universe, which seems to rotate daily, is the scene for the remainder of the epic.
25–8. After the Restoration of Charles II (May 1660) until the passage of the Act of Oblivion (August 1660),
Milton was in danger of death and dismemberment (like Orpheus, lines 34 –5). Several of his republican
colleagues were hanged, drawn, and quartered for their part in the revolution and regicide.
29–30. Milton’s early biographers report that he composed at night or in the early hours of the morning,
then waited for a scribe to take down his dictation.
32–7 Thracian Bard. Orpheus, the archtypal poet, whose “Harp and Voice” charmed even “Woods and Rocks,”
but were drowned out by the Bacchantes, a “wilde Rout” of screaming women who murdered and dismembered him in the “Rhodope” mountains in Thrace, and threw his body parts into the river Hebrus
(cf. “Lycidas,” 58–63). Milton fears that a similar “barbarous dissonance” unleashed by the Restoration
royalists will drown his voice and threaten his life.
37–8 Muse. Calliope, the Muse of epic poetry, was the mother of Orpheus.
40–50. The second epic question (paralleling 1.27–33), signals that Book 7 is the beginning, structurally, of
the poem’s second half; Virgil makes a similar gesture in Book 7 of the Aeneid.
72 Divine interpreter. Echoes Mercury’s title as messenger of the gods, “interpres divum” (Aeneid 4.378).
88–9 ambient Aire. The surrounding air “yeelds” to solids or “fills” the spaces between them.
interfus’d. Interfusus, poured between (Latin).
90–3. Adam’s question about God’s actions before the Creation was often cited by theologians as an example of presumptuous and dangerous speculation, especially when, as here, it implies mutability in God.
But in Milton’s Eden error that is not deliberate is not sinful.
98–106. Pleas to continue a story are common in epic, see Odyssey 11.372 – 6, where Alcinous urges Odysseus
to continue speaking until dawn.
103 Deep. Chaos, invisible (“unapparent”) because dark and without form.
126–30 Knowledge is as food. A commonplace. Cf. Davanant, Gondibert (1651): “For though books serve
as diet for the mind, / If knowledge, early got, self-value breeds, / By false digestion it is turned to wind,
/ And what would nourish on the eater feeds” (2.8.22–5).
131–3 Lucifer. Now known as Satan, he is brighter among the angels than the morning star of that name is
among the other stars.
142 us dispossest. Once he had dispossessed us (a Latinism).
144 thir place. Echoes Job 7:10, about the dead: “He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his
place know him any more.”
145 greater part. Cf. Satan’s conflicting representations of the numbers of the rebels (1.633, 6.156. 9.141–2)
and see 2.692.
154 in a moment. See below, 176–8.
156–9 under long obedience tri’d. Cf. Raphael’s explanation of how man was intended to improve
(5.469–503). See Areopagitica on human nature and life in Eden: “many there be that complain of divin
Providence for suffering Adam to transgresse, foolish tongues! when God gave him reason, he gave him
freedom to choose, for reason is but choosing . . . God therefore left him free, set before him a provoking object, ever almost in his eyes; herein consisted his merit, herein the right of his reward, the praise of
his abstinence. Wherefore did he creat passions within us, pleasures round about us, but that these rightly
temper’d are the very ingredients of vertu?”
163–5. Milton’s God identifies himself as Creator and the Son as his agent, speaking his creating word;
cf. Christian Doctrine 1.5: “The Son . . . was the first of the whole creation, by whom afterwards all other
things were made.” The “Spirit” probably means the power of God, as Christian Doctrine 1.7 indicates.
168–73. Milton’s God creates out of Chaos, not out of nothing (ex nihilo) as most theologians held. The matter of Chaos emanated from God, and because God fills “Infinitude” Chaos (“the Deep”) is infinite. God
chooses when to “retire” or restrict his “goodness” (active power) to the empyreal heavens, leaving Chaos
subject to “Chance” and to other agents. God also freely chooses when to put forth that “goodness” into
Chaos and create heaven, the universe, and all creatures from it; his power is limited neither by
“Necessitie” nor “Chance,” which are causes of creation in some ancient philosophy (cf. Christian Doctrine
1.7; PL 2.955–1009, 10.282–305).
176–9. Raphael explains the principle of accommodation, whereby God’s acts, which are “Immediate” and
so described in some commentary on Genesis, are translated into the narrative terms humans can understand, here, a six-day Creation. This principle allows an escape from biblical literalism. Cf. the Creation
account given by Uriel to Satan disguised as a Cherub (3.705–21).
182–3. Cf. Luke 2:14, the angels’ song at the birth of Jesus: “Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace,
good will toward men.”
199–201 Chariots wing’d. Cf. Zech. 6:1, “behold, there came four chariots out from between two mountains . . . of brass.”
205–9 Harmonious sound. Cf. 2.880–1, and 565–8 below and note.
225 golden Compasses. Wisdom, in Prov. 8:27, declares, “When he prepared the heavens, I was there: when
he set a compass upon the face of the depth.”
233–5 Matter unform’d and void. Cf. Gen. 1:2, “And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness
was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.” Cf. PL 1.21–2.
237–8 tartareous. Crusty, gritty matter (“infernal dregs”), purged from the universe and associated with
Tartarus, hell.
243. God’s creating words, here and later, are quoted almost exactly from Gen. 1 (cf. chapters 1 and 2), but
Milton freely elaborates the creatures’ responses.
244 Ethereal. Ether was thought to be a fifth element or “quintessence,” the substance of the celestial bodies
above the moon.
252 Eev’n and Morn. One twenty-four-hour period measured from sundown to sundown, in the Jewish
manner.
261–75 Firmament. The space between the earth and the outer shell (“uttermost convex”) of the universe,
filled with transparent air; it is the visible “Heav’n” or sky (274), not the ethereal heaven where God and
the angels reside. The “Waters underneath” are the oceans on which the earth rests; the waters “above”
are the “circumfluous Waters,” comprising a “Crystallin Ocean” that surrounds the outer shell of the universe; “Chaos” is thereby “farr remov’d” from creation.
276–81. Earth is at first an “Embryo” enveloped in a “Womb . . . / Of Waters”; then she is herself the “great
Mother” made ready (“Fermented”) to conceive and bear every other creature. Milton draws on
Lucretius, De Rerum Natura (2.991–8), for the concept of earth as Magna Mater and also on Ovid’s account
of Creation (Metamorphoses 1.1–51).
320
321–2 cornie Reed. Stalks bearing grain; they appear as a forest of spears uplifted by a battalion
(“Embattell’d”). Cf. 4.980–3.
331–7. Cf. Gen. 2:5–6: “[God made] every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the
field before it grew: for the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man
to till the ground. But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.”
360
360 cloudie Shrine. The “cloudie Tabernacle” (248 above) where light had been stored.
366 Morning Planet. probably Venus, which Galileo’s telescope found to be crescent-shaped (“guilds her
horns”) in her first quarter. The 1667 edition has “his horns” which would refer to Lucifer, who was named
by Raphael as the brightest star at 7.131 and is designated as the morning star in the Nativity Ode, 74.
The change accommodates Gallileo’s finding.
373 Longitude. Course round the ecliptic, from east to west (not the modern use of the term).
374–5 Pleiades. Seven daughters of Atlas, transformed to a cluster of stars known as the Seven Sisters; they
rise in the spring and are thought to shed fertility (“sweet influence”) into the earth. Cf. Job 38:31, “Canst
thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades.”
388 Reptil. All creatures that crawl or creep. They are the first animate creatures, having a “living Soule.”
402–3. The fishes’ darting motions resemble boats (“Sculles”) oared now on one side, now on the other; as
they turn they seem to form a “Bank” within the sea.
412 Leviathan. The great whale (cf. 1.200–8).
420–1 callow. Unfeathered, but soon they have full plumage (“fledge”) and the wing feathers (“summ’d thir
Penns”) needed for flight.
422–3 despis’d. Looked down upon (the literal meaning); the ground seemed to be under a cloud of birds.
429–30 mutual wing. Birds were thought to support each other when they fly in formation.
438–40. The swan’s outstretched (“mantling”) wings seem to form a cloak; it resembles a monarch on a
royal barge (“state”), rowing itself with its “Oarie” feet.
460–2 Those. The wild beasts who come forth “in Pairs” and spread out (“rare”) at wide intervals.
these. Domestic cattle, who come forth “in flocks” and “broad Herds,” and at once find pasture.
471 Behemoth. A huge biblical beast ( Job. 40:15–24), often identified with the elephant.
474 River Horse. Translates the Greek hippopotamus.
476 Worme. Any creeping creature, including serpents.
485–9 Parsimonious Emmet. The thrifty ant, with its capacious intellect (“large heart”) will become the
symbol of a frugal and self-governing republic (“Pattern of just equalitie”), with the “popular” (populous,
plebeian) tribes of common people (“Commonaltie”) joining in rule. In The Ready and Easy Way, Milton
makes ant colonies a symbol “of a frugal and self governing democratie or Commonwealth; safer and more
thriving in the joint providence and counsel of many industrious equals, then under the single domination of one imperious Lord.”
489–92 Deliciously. Bees here suggest delightful ease but become a symbol of monarchy associated with
Hell (1.768–75).
495
493. See PL 8.342–4 and Gen. 2:19–20.
495–7 hairie Main. Evokes the sea serpents (Aeneid 2.203–11) who emerged from the sea to destroy Laocoon
and his sons, and so was instrumental in the fall of Troy.
508–9 erect. Both “stand erect” and “elevate his condition.” His erect stance was understood to signify that
he was intended for Heaven; see 8.257–61.
511 Magnanimous. Noble, great-souled.
correspond. Both “be in harmony with” and “communicate
with.”
519–22 similitude. Likeness; cf. Gen. 1:26: “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness.” The Geneva
Bible comments that humans were created “after God in righteousnes & true holines, meaning by these two
wordes all perfection, as wisdome, trueth, innocencie, power.” Commenting on Gen. 1:27, “So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them,” Milton
in Tetrachordon defines the divine image in man as “Wisdom, Purity, Justice, and rule over all creatures.”
524–8. Cf. Gen. 2:7: “And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.”
557 Idea. Eternal archetype or pattern, as in Plato; concept in the mind of God.
565–7. Cf. Ps. 24:7: “Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lifted up, ye everlasting doors; and the King
of glory shall come in.” See lines 205–9 above.
596–7 Dulcimer. The Hebrew bagpipe (Dan. 3:5).
Fret. Bar on the fingerboard of a stringed instrument.
600 Golden Censers. Incense burners, cf. Rev. 8:3–4: “another angel came and stood at the altar, having a
golden censer; and there was given unto him much incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all
the saints . . . And the smoke of the incense . . . ascended up before God.”
605 Giant Angels. This allusion to the Giants’ revolt against Jove implies that the Greek myth is a classical
type or version of the angels’ rebellion.
618–20 Hyaline. From the Greek for glass (Rev. 4:6, “a sea of glass like unto crystal”). The universe is constructed (“founded”) on this sea, the “Crystallin Ocean” above the firmament (see line 271 above), as opposed
to the “nether Ocean” (624), the earth’s seas.
631–2. Contrast Virgil, Georgics 2.458–9, on the happiness of farmers who live in harmony with an abundant
nature: “O happy husbandmen! too happy, should they come to know their blessings!”
634 Halleluiahs. Hebrew, Praise the Lord.
5
1 doubtfully. Ambiguously.
14. Introducing Raphael’s prototype of astronomical treatises, notably Galileo’s Dialogue Concerning the Two
Chief World Systems (Italian, 1632; Latin and English trans., 1635). Adam stands in the place of Galileo’s
Sagredo, an intelligent inquirer who seeks to be informed about the movement of the planets, while Raphael
takes on the role, first, of the Ptolemaic apologist (Simplicio), then of the Copernican (Salviati).
15–38. Relying on his senses, Adam assumes the universe is Ptolemaic, but finds logical difficulties in that
system. Cf. Eve’s question at 4:657–8, and Adam’s answer.
52–7 preferr’d. The emphasis on Eve’s choice indicates that she is not bound by Paul’s prohibition in 1 Cor.
14:35, “If they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to
speak in the church,” but observes this hierarchical decorum for her own pleasure.
61 Graces. The attendants of Venus.
62–3 Darts of desire. The Petrarchan language identifies Eve’s graces as prompting desire, but the next line
redefines that desire in non-sexual terms.
67 Book of God. The Book of Nature, commonly understood as a second divine revelation.
71–5 the rest. Presumably, God’s purposes and designs throughout the whole universe (“His secrets”) – as
opposed to the specific factual issue, “whether Heav’n move or Earth” (70), which may be blamelessly
searched but which “Imports not” to a proper admiration of God’s “wondrous Works” (68).
82 save appeerances. Find ways of explaining discrepancies between their astronomical theories and the observed
movements of the heavenly bodies.
83–4 Eccentric. Off-center. In the Ptolemaic system, observed irregularities in the motion of heavenly bodies were first explained by hypothesizing orbits with the earth off-center, then by adding “Epicycles,” which
were smaller orbits whose centers ride on fixed points on the circumferences of the main orbits, and carry
the planets. The Copernican system also had some recourse to epicycles.
90. Raphael here begins his rationale for the Ptolemaic system.
117–18 Not that I so affirm. Raphael refuses to “reveal” astronomical truth to Adam, leaving that matter
open to human scientific speculation. He suggests that Adam’s Ptolemaic assumptions result from his earthbound perspective, and implies that angels from their perspective see the cosmos in other terms.
122–58. Raphael now argues the case for Copernican astronomy and introduces still more advanced scientific
notions that Adam had not imagined – multiple universes and other inhabited planets.
126 wandring. Elliptical. The word planet comes from the Greek word for wanderer.
127 Progressive. Moving west to east.
retrograde. Moving east to west (contrary to the order of the
zodiac signs).
128 six. The six planets we see move: Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, Mercury, and the moon. Raphael suggests
that “the Planet Earth” rather than the sun may be the “sev’nth,” moving imperceptibly (“Insensibly”).
130 three differrent Motions. According to Copernicus the three motions are daily rotation, annual revolution around the sun, and “motion in declination” to align the earth’s axis always with the same point
in the celestial sphere.
132 thwart obliquities. Irregular and “contrarie” paths that cross each other, which, if the earth doesn’t rotate,
you must “else” ascribe to the planets (131).
133–6 rhomb. Greek, wheel. The invisible tenth or outer sphere (Primum Mobile), “suppos’d” by Ptolemaic
astronomers to revolve every twenty-four hours (“Nocturnal and Diurnal”) carrying the planets with it; this
concept is necessary if you would “save the Sun his labour,” but if the earth rotates it “needs not thy beleefe.”
148–9 Moons. Planets “attendant” upon a sun; they exchange reflected light reciprocally but also have some
“peculiar” light of their own (7.368). Galileo had discovered four of the moons of Jupiter.
150–1 Male and Femal Light. The sun and moon had long been gendered, through association of the sun
with Apollo and the moon with Diana; here their light is imagined to be a sexually active force, “perhaps”
endowing the several planets with life (“animate”).
152. Bruno and Descartes were among those who accepted the idea that suns, planets, and moons were inhabited; Kepler rejected the idea.
187–9. Cf. Belial’s “thoughts that wander through Eternity” (2.148).
195
230 Bound on a voyage uncouth° and obscure,
250–333. Cf. Eve’s recollection of her earliest moments of consciousness (4.449 –76).
250–1. Cf. Satan’s inability to remember his creation (5.859–63) and the very different inference he draws
from that fact.
271–3. Many exegetes speculated that Adam spontaneously spoke Hebrew; Milton in his Art of Logic did not
specify the language but wrote that it was “without doubt divinely given.” Adam’s ability to name the
creatures was taken to indicate his intuitive understanding of their natures.
273–82. Adam instinctively works out the central principles of natural theology: that there is a Creator and
that he should be adored.
292 at my Head a dream. In the Iliad (2.20) a dream sent by Zeus in the guise of Nestor stands at
Agamemnon’s head. Compare Eve’s dream (4.800–9, 5.30 – 93).
206
351. blandishment. Flattering gestures.
stoop’d. Bowed.
352–4. Adam has already named the sun and features of the earth (272–3); here he names, and thereby understands by intuition (“sudden apprehension”), all living creatures.
357–60. Adam cannot name, and thereby indicates that he cannot understand, God, except as God reveals
himself.
384–8 harmonie. As with poorly matched musical instruments, Adam’s string is too taut (“intense”) and the
animals’ string is too slack (“remiss”) to be in harmony (“suite”).
402 pleasure. “Eden” is Hebrew for “pleasure.”
415–17 perfet. God is absolutely perfect, man is perfect only “in degree,” relatively.
421. God, though One, contains all numbers.
423 single imperfection. The imperfection of being alone; humans need to perfect themselves through social
intercourse (“by number”).
431 deifi’d. Made, by grace, able to rise to “Union or Communion” with God.
437 try. God has played the role of a Socratic teacher, offering Adam erroneous formulations and thereby
prodding him to discover for himself essential truths about human nature.
444–50. Cf. Gen. 2:18: “And the Lord God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him
an help meet for him.” Milton’s gloss on “help meet” in Tetrachordon, “God as it were not satisfy’d with
the naming of a help, goes on describing another self, a second self, a very self it self,” and God’s words in the
epic, “Thy likeness, thy fit help, thy other self,” reinforce Milton’s ideal of companionate marriage. These
words even seem to posit gender equality, by contrast to the hierarchy affirmed elsewhere.
460–1 Cell / Of Fancie. Cf. Adam’s explanation of the role of Fancy to Eve (5.100 –13).
465 left side. Some commentators explained that the left side is nearest the heart; others pointed to the left
as the “sinister” side, foreshadowing Eve’s role in the Fall.
466 cordial spirits. The so-called “vital spirits” that the heart distributes throughout the body.
478–520. Cf. Eve’s version of these events (4.467–91).
490
495–9. Cf. Gen. 2:23–4: “And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be
called Woman, because she was taken out of Man. Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother,
and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.”
511. Cf. Raphael’s “rosie red” glow at 8.618–19.
519–20 Eevning Starr. The rising of Hesperus was the signal among the ancients for lighting the “bridal
Lamp” and conducting the bride to the bridegroom.
543–4 resembling less. Most commentators on Genesis agreed that Eve was a less perfect image of God
than was Adam.
553 Looses. Becomes unstable.
discount’nanc’t. Disconcerted.
556 Occasionally. Contingently, to meet Adam’s need.
557 Greatness of mind. Intellectual excellence and also magnanimity.
574 Head. See 1 Cor. 11:3, “The head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and
the head of Christ is God.”
585 passion. Most commentators on Genesis agreed that Adam and Eve did not feel passion before the Fall.
Raphael seems to indicate that they should not (588–9) but he may not understand the human condition
fully, or he may mean simply that passions, which clearly Adam and Eve do feel in the state of innocence,
must not overthrow reason. See Areopagitica: “Wherefore did he creat passions within us, pleasures round
about us, but that these rightly temper’d are the very ingredients of vertu?”
591–2 scale. Raphael summarizes the Neoplatonic ladder of love (see Plato, Symposium 211C –D), by which
humans may move from sensual love to higher stages of human love, and ultimately to love of the Good,
or God.
598–600. Adam takes respectful issue with Raphael’s apparent denigration of human sex in his account of
the Neoplatonic ladder.
mysterious. At Eph. 5:31–2 Paul speaks of the marital union (“one flesh”)
as a “great mystery,” as it reflects the union of Christ and the Church.
609–10. i.e., “various objects, variously represented to me by my senses.”
619. Red is the color traditionally associated with Seraphim, who burn with ardor. Raphael’s smile also glows
with friendship for Adam, and appreciation of his perceptive inference about angelic sex. Given the monism
Raphael explains in Book 5 (469–500) and demonstrates by eating human food, Raphael has to be made
to qualify his apparent Neoplatonic dualism in seeming so sharply to separate physical and spiritual love.
631 Earths green Cape. Cape Verde near Dakar and the islands off that coast are the westernmost
(“Hesperian”) points of Africa.
634–5. Cf. 1 John 5:3: “this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments.”
16 amaz’d. Stunned.
1–47. In this fourth Proem, Milton does not invoke the Muse but testifies (21– 2) to her customary nightly
visits, “unimplor’d.”
1–6. The Miltonic Bard declares a shift in mode from the pastoral of “rural repast” and eclogue (which here
includes georgic labor, physical and intellectual) to “Tragic.”
13–19. The Bard proposes that the tragedy of the Fall surpasses the tragic element in several classical epics:
“Achilles” pursuing the fleeing (“Fugitive”) Hector (“his Foe”) three times around “Troy Wall” before killing
him; “Turnus” fighting and then killed by Aeneas, who had received as wife Turnus’ betrothed (“Lavinia
disespous’d”); Odysseus (“the Greek”) tormented by “Neptun’s ire” for blinding his son Polyphemus; and
Aeneas (“Cytherea’s [Venus’s] Son” plagued by “Juno’s” anger because Venus had been judged by Paris to
be more beautiful than Juno or Minerva.
21 Celestial Patroness. Urania, named in 7.1.
22–4 dictates to me slumbering. Milton’s verses seem to pour forth directly (“unpremeditated”) from the
Muse’s inspiration; they are the product of a lifetime of study, thought, and experience. Milton’s nephew,
Edward Phillips, reports that Milton often awoke in the morning with lines of poetry fully formed and
ready to be dictated to an amanuensis.
25–6. See Introduction, pp. xviii–xix, for an account of Milton’s “long” consideration of possible epic subjects and plans.
30–1 Battels feign’d. Milton disparages the customary subjects of epic and romance, with allusion to the
Arthurian matter he once considered as subject for a national epic, but then rejected as merely fables.
34–7. Milton now rejects several familar elements of contemporary romantic epics (Ariosto, Tasso, Spenser).
tilting Furniture. Equipment for jousting.
Impreses quaint. Ingenious heraldic devices on shields.
Caparisons. Ornamental coverings or armor for horses.
Bases. Cloth coverings for horses.
tinsel Trappings. Coverings over the harness or saddle of horses, ornamented with gold or silver threads.
37 marshal’d Feast. Well ordered, with guests arranged according to rank.
44–6 That name. The designation, heroic poem.
age too late. The Restoration era might well be
unreceptive to this poem.
cold / Climat. Milton long believed that England’s climate was less amenable
to epic poetry than the warmth of the Mediterranean region.
Years. His own advanced age (he was
in his fifties when writing the poem).
damp. Benumb.
intended wing / Deprest. Purposed
poetic flights held down, kept from soaring.
49–50 Hesperus. The evening star, actually the planet Venus.
62–6. By circling the globe from east to west at the equator (“Equinoctial Line”) for three nights and then
longitudinally for four nights over the north and south poles (“From Pole to Pole”) Satan can remain in
darkness (“rode / With darkness”), keeping himself always in the earth’s shadow, ahead of the advancing
edge of the sun’s light.
Carr of Night. The earth’s shadow, imagined as a chariot driven by the
goddess, Night.
Colure. The colures were two great circles intersecting at right angles at the poles.
70 Now not. No longer existing.
71 Tigris. Cf. Gen. 2:10, one of the four rivers that flowed out of the garden (“Paradise”).
77–82. A reprise of Satan’s journey in geographical terms. In his north–south circles he passed the Black Sea
(“Pontus”), thence to the Sea of Azov in Russia (“Mœotis”), then beond the River Obi (“Ob”) in Siberia,
which flows into the Arctic Ocean, then south to Antarctica (“Antartic”). His westward circles bring him
from the Syrian river “Orontes” flowing into the Meditteranean Sea, then across the Atlantic which is
“barr’d” at the Isthmus of Panama (“Darien”), then across the Pacific and Asia to India, where the “Ganges”
and “Indus” rivers flow.
86. The serpent is so described in Gen. 3:1.
105–7. Cf. the different views of the cosmos held by Eve (4.657 – 8), Adam (8.15 – 38), and Raphael (8.98 – 9,
114–78).
141–2. Cf. the conflicting estimates of the rebel numbers at 1.632 – 3, 2.692, and 6.156. Cf. Rev. 12:3 – 4, the
casting down of “the third part of the stars of heaven.”
146–7 his Created. Cf. 5.853–63 and 4.43.
151 spoils. Goods seized from a defeated enemy.
156 flaming Ministers. Cf. Heb. 1:7: “Who maketh his angels spirits and his ministers a flame of fire.”
166 imbrute. Satan embodying his “essence” in a snake parodies the Son becoming “incarnate” as man.
220
231–4. Adam’s praises invite comparison with the qualities of a virtuous wife set forth in Prov. 31, especially
verses 27–8: “She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness. Her
children arise up and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praiseth her.”
260
270 Virgin. Unspotted, peerless. Virginity in Puritan usage can include chaste marriage. See Calvin, Institutes
4.12:28: “the second sort of virginity is the chaste love of matrimony.” Cf. PL 4.737–73.
275–8 over-heard. Eve had been “attentive” to all of Raphael’s story about Satan (7:51), but evidently hears
his reiterated warnings from a “shadie nook” when she returns from tending her flowers just as he departs
(8:41–51, 633–643).
309–12. In Renaissance Neoplatonism, love (and especially the sight of the beloved) inspired the lover to
virtue.
322–41. Compare and contrast Areopagitica: “I cannot praise a fugitive and cloister’d vertue, unexercis’d &
unbreath’d, that never sallies out and sees her adversary, but slinks out of the race, where that immortall
garland is to be run for, not without dust and heat. Assuredly we bring not innocence into the world, we
bring impurity much rather: that which purifies us is triall, and triall is by what is contrary.”
349–56 Reason he made right. Right Reason, a classical concept accommodated to Christian (Scholastic)
philosophy, is the God-given power to apprehend truth and the moral law. See Christian Doctrine 1.4: “Reason
has been implanted in all, by which they may of themselves resist bad desires.” Also, cf. PL 5.520 – 9.
386–90 light. Light-footed, quick, but with overtones of fickle or frivolous.
Oread. A mountain-nymph.
Dryad. A wood-nymph.
Delia. Diana, born on the isle of Delos, hunted with a “Traine” of nymphs,
and with “Bow and Quiver.”
392 Guiltless of fire. Without experience of fire, unneeded in Paradise. So Eve’s gardening tools are necessarily “rude.” A possible allusion also to the guilt of Prometheus, who stole fire from heaven.
393–6 Pales. Goddess of flocks and pastures.
Pomona. Goddess of fruit-trees; she was chased by the
wood-god “Vertumnus” in many guises, before surrendering to him.
Ceres. Goddess of harvests, in
the springtime (“Prime”) of life before she was impregnated by “Jove” with “Proserpina,” whose abduction
by Pluto to Hades brought winter to the world.
404–11. The author’s direct address to a character is a Homeric formula.
431–3. Echoing 4:268–72, the conceit of Eve as Proserpine, the flower-gatherer who was herself gathered by
“gloomie Dis.”
440–1 reviv’d Adonis. The Garden of Adonis was a beautiful pleasure garden named for the lovely youth
loved by Venus, killed by a boar, and, in some versions of the myth, revived and enjoyed by Venus in
that garden (cf. Faerie Queene 3.6.29–46).
Alcinous. The Phæacian king who entertained “Laertes Son”
Odysseus in magnificent gardens (Odyssey 7.112–35).
442–3 Sapient King. Solomon, noted for his wisdom (sapience) entertained his “fair Egyptian Spouse,” the
queen of Sheba, in a lovely garden (S. of S. 6:2) that was real, not mythic (“Mystic”) as the others were.
461 rapine sweet. From Latin rapere, to seize, the root of both “rape” and “rapture,” underscoring the paradox of the ravisher (temporarily) ravished.
bereav’d. Took from.
475
505–7 Cadmus. The legendary founder of Thebes, and his wife Harmonia (“Hermione”) were changed to
serpents when they went to “Illyria” (Albania) in old age.
the God. Aesculapius, god of healing,
sometimes came forth as a serpent from his temple in “Epidaurus” – erect, crested, and with gilded folds
like Satan’s serpent (Ovid, Metamorphoses 15.622–744).
507–10 Ammonian Jove. Jupiter Ammon made love to “Olympias” in the form of a serpent, and sired
Alexander the Great.
Capitoline. Jupiter Capitolinus in serpent form sired “Scipio” Africanus, the
“highth of Rome” (greatest Roman), who defeated Hannibal.
521–2 Circean call. The witch Circe transformed men into a “Herd disguis’d” of fawning animals (Odyssey
10:212–19; Metamorphoses 14.45f ).
529–30 Organic. Satan either used the actual tongue (organ) of the serpent or else produced vibrations (“impulse”)
in the air to produce speech.
532–48. Satan’s entire speech is couched in the extravagant phrases and conceits of the Petrarchan love tradition; cf. Eve’s dream at 5.38–93.
585
581–2 sweetest Fenel. According to Pliny serpents ate fennel to aid in shedding their skins and to sharpen
their eyesight; folklore had it that they drank the milk of sheep and goats.
585 fair Apples. Genesis does not identify the forbidden fruit as apples, but that identification became conventional, probably because in Latin malum means both apple and evil (malus).
599–604 to degree. To bring on by degrees “Of Reason.” There is no precedent in Genesis or the interpretative tradition for Satan’s argument by analogy based on the snake’s supposed experience of attaining to
reason and speech by eating the forbidden fruit.
606–12. Satan continues his Petrarchan language of courtship.
613 spirited. Both inspired by and possessed by an evil spirit, Satan.
629 blowing. Blossoming trees that exude the aromatic gums, “Myrrh” and “Balme” (balsam).
634–42 wandring Fire. Will-o’-the-wisp, phosphorescent marsh gas, composed (“compact”) of an oily
(“unctuous”) exhalation kindled through friction (“agitation”) to a “Flame.” Often mistaken for “evil
Spirits,” such fires frightened and misled the bewildered (“amaz’d”) “Night-wanderer” into “Boggs and Mires.”
653–4 Daughter of his voice. A Hebraism, Bath Kol, daughter of a voice. This is God’s “Sole” direct commandment; otherwise their unfallen “Reason” leads them to understand and follow the moral “Law”
of nature.
659–63. Cf. Gen. 3:1–3: “Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the Lord God
had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?
And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden: But of the fruit
of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch
it, lest ye die.” Eve’s formulation indicates her “sufficient” understanding of the prohibition.
668–9 act / Rais’d. Drawn up to full dignity.
670–2 som Orator renound. Like the Athenian Demosthenes or the Roman Cicero, defending liberty “som
great cause.”
free Rome. Rome when it was a republic.
since mute. Such oratory no longer
exists, presumably because such love of liberty (in monarchical Europe, and now including England) no
longer exists.
675–8 brooking. Allowing; Satan omits the usual rhetorical practice of beginning with a “Preface” and
rising by stages to “highth” of style, but rather begins his speech at once in an “impassion’d” high style
(“to highth upgrown”).
685 ye shall not Die. Cf. Gen. 3:4, “And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die.”
689 Fate. As often before, Satan ascribes ultimate agency to Fate rather than God.
695 whatever thing Death be. Satan has of course met Death (2.781–814; cf. 4.425– 7).
698–9 if what is evil / Be real. Theologians normally defined evil as a privation of or turning away from
good; on that assumption Satan argues that evil has no real existence.
708 Gods. Satan often equivocates with the term suggesting the angels’ equality with God; throughout this
passage he explicitly describes them as a pantheon of gods (cf. 718–19).
711 proportion meet. Satan invites Adam and Eve to aspire to divinity based on analogy with the supposed
experience of the snake.
713–15. Satan perverts the Pauline concept of death to sin (Col. 3:3, 9 –10): “For ye are dead, and your life
is hid with Christ in God . . . ye have put off the old man with his deeds; And have put on the new man,
which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him.”
716–17. Compare and contrast Raphael’s prediction of human evolution (5.491–500).
729–30. An echo of Virgil’s comment on Juno’s anger (Aeneid 1.11), “Can so much anger dwell in heavenly
hearts.”
735–40 eager appetite. Cf. Gen. 3:6: “the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise.”
744 Pausing a while. The pause makes Eve’s action a matter of willed choice, not merely impulsive.
785
782–4. Earth felt the wound. Cf. Rom. 8:22: “we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in
pain together.” See also 9.1000–4 and 10.651–714.
795–807. Cf. Adam and Eve’s morning hymn (5:144–208).
804 Gods. Like Satan, Eve now refers to a pantheon of gods.
835–7 low Reverence. Eve’s idolatry of the “power” within the tree recalls the idolatrous reverence the rebel
angels offered to Satan (2.477–9).
853–4 excuse. Eve’s expression as she approached Adam first registered “excuse,” like the “Prologue” in a
play, and “Apologie” ( justification, self-defense) served as prompter to her speech.
867 tasted. Proved by tasting, also, experienced, tested.
887 distemper. Disturbance of the balance of humors in the body, here causing agitation and wild excitement, marked by a hectic “flushing.”
900
895–916. Compare Eve in soliloquy (816–33).
914–15. Adam echoes Gen. 2:23–4: “This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: . . . Therefore
shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.”
Cf. 8.495 above.
244
974–5 Direct, or by occasion. The direct or indirect “good” of tasting the fruit has been the “happie trial”
of Adam’s love.
977–81. Cf. Eve’s earlier comment (826–33).
997–9. Cf. 1 Tim. 2:14: “And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression.”
1003–4 Sin / Original. The theological doctrine that all Adam’s descendants are stained by Adam’s sin and
thereby subject to physical death and (unless saved by grace) to damnation. Cf. Christian Doctrine 1.11.
1026 ten. Looks forward to the Mosaic covenant, with its ten commandments.
1029–32. Echoes Zeus’ amorous invitation to Hera (Iliad 14.314 –28), and also Paris to Helen (Iliad 3.441– 6).
1037. Cf. other places where Adam and Eve join and disjoin hands: 4.321, 488 – 9, 9.385– 6, 12.648.
1039–45. Cf. Adam and Eve’s lovemaking in innocence: 4:705–10, 738 – 43, 771–3.
1058–9 hee. “shame” now “cover’d” them, but revealed (“Uncover’d”) their guilt.
1059–62 Danite. Samson, of the tribe of Dan, told the Philistine “Harlot” “Dalilah” that the secret of his great
strength lay in his hair; she sheared it off while he slept, and when he awoke he was easily captured by
his enemies and blinded.
1067 Eve, in evil hour. Adam’s bitter pun suggests a false etymology for Eve’s name and repudiates the actual
etymology, “life,” which Adam will later reaffirm (11.159– 61).
1071–3. Adam, like most commentators, derives the tree’s name, the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil,
from its effect. Cf. Christian Doctrine 1.10: “since Adam tasted it, we not only know evil, but we know
good only by means of evil.”
1078–80 concupiscence. The theological term for the unruly human passions and desires seen as one effect
of the Fall, and causing an abundance (“store”) of evils. “Shame” is the “last” evil, the “first” is the “foul
concupiscence” that produces it.
1095–1110 broad smooth leaves. The banyan, or Indian fig tree, has small leaves, but the account Milton
draws on from Gerard’s Herbal (1597) contains the several details related in these lines. “Malabar” and “Decan”
(Deccan) are in southern India.
1111 Amazonian Targe. Shield of the Amazons, female warriors of Greek myth.
1150
250
 
Shee first his weak indulgence will accuse.
Thus they in mutual accusation spent
The fruitless hours, but neither self-condemning,
And of thir vain contest appeer’d no end.
The End of the Ninth Book.
252
16 manifold in sin. Having multiple sins. In Christian Doctrine 1.11 Milton suggests that no sin “can be named,
which was not included in this one act.”
29 Accountable. Liable to be called to answer for how they fulfilled their duties (guarding Paradise).
31 easily approv’d. Their plea of “utmost vigilance” was readily accepted.
38–9 Foretold so lately. Cf. 3.80–96.
43–7 no Decree of mine. Cf. 3.96–128.
49–50 Death denounc’t. Formally proclaimed; cf. Gen. 2:17: “But of the tree of the knowledge of good and
evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.” Cf. PL 8:323–33.
53 Forbearance no acquittance. God’s restraint (“Forbearance”) in exacting punishment does not “acquit”
Adam of the punishment due. “Omittance is not quittance” was a proverb.
54. i.e., my justice must not be “scorn’d” as my generosity (“bountie”) has been.
56–7 All Judgement. Cf. John 5:22: “For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto
the Son.”
60–1 Mediator. Cf. Christian Doctrine 1.15, “The mediatorial office of Christ is that whereby . . . he voluntarily performed, and continues to perform, on behalf of man, whatever is requisite for obtaining reconciliation with God, and eternal salvation.”
70 Son belov’d. Cf. Matt. 3:17: “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.”
90–1 strait. Immediate; cf. Raphael’s journey from heaven to earth (8.110 –14).
92–102. Cf. Gen. 3:8: “And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the
day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the
garden.”
121–3. Cf. Gen. 3:11, “And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof
I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?”
137–43. Compare Adam’s speech in Gen. 3:12, “The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me
of the tree, and I did eat.”
148–50 of thee, / And for thee. Cf. 1 Cor. 11:8–9, “For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of
the man. Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man.”
157–62. Cf. Gen. 3:13, “And the Lord God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the
woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.”
165–7. i.e., the serpent was “unable” to “transferre” his own “Guilt” in being “polluted” to Satan, who made
him his “instrument.”
169–70 more to know. Adam and Eve cannot now understand the terms of the judgment on the serpent.
175–8. Cf. Gen. 3:14, which these lines closely paraphrase.
179–81. Cf. Gen. 3:15: “And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her
seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.” This is the “protoevangelium,” or judgment
of Satan in the serpent, that contains the promise of the redeemer, the woman’s “Seed.” Adam and Eve
do not fully understand it until 12.429–33, 598–605.
183–4. Cf. Jesus’ comment to his disciples (Luke 10:18), “I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven.”
185–8 Prince of the Aire. Cf. Eph. 2:2, where Satan is called “prince of the power of the air”; Col. 2:15, which
states that Christ, “having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing
over them”; and Eph. 4:8, declaring that when Christ “ascended up on high, he led captivity captive.”
193–6. Cf. Gen. 3:16: “Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in
sorrow thou shalt bring forth children, and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.”
In Christian Doctrine 1.10 Milton claimed that after the Fall the husband’s power over his wife was
increased.
197–208. Cf. Gen. 3:17–19: “And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy
wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the
ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life; Thorns also and thistles shall it
bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field; In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread,
till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou
return.”
214–17 form of servant. Cf. Phil. 2:7; John 13:5 tells of Jesus washing his disciples’ feet; Gen. 3:21 records
that the “Lord God made coats of skins, and clothed” Adam and Eve.
222–3. Cf. Isa. 61:10: “he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness.”
260
 
290 Upon the Cronian Sea, together drive
290–3 Cronian Sea. The Arctic Ocean.
th’imagin’d way. The northeast passage from Pechora
(“Petsora”), a river in Siberia, to north China (Cathay) which Henry Hudson looked for in 1608 but could
only imagine because it was blocked by ice.
294–6 Mace petrific. Death’s materials are the “cold and dry” elements. His mace is associated with
Neptune’s “Trident,” which was said to have “fix’t” the “floating” Greek island “Delos.”
297 Gorgonian rigor. The Gorgon Medusa turned to stone anything she looked upon.
306 great things to small. A familiar Virgilian formula.
307–11. The Persian king “Xerxes” ordered the sea whipped when it destroyed the bridge of ships he built
over the Hellespont ( joining “Europe with Asia”), so as to invade Greece. Susa. The biblical Shusan, Xerxes’
winter residence, was founded by the mythical Prince Memnon (“Memnonian Palace”).
313 Pontifical. Bridge-building, with a pun on “papal.” The pope had the title Pontifex Maximus.
323–4 three sev’ral wayes. The golden staircase or chain linking the universe to Heaven (3.510 –18); the
new bridge linking it to Hell; and the passage through the spheres down to earth (3:526 – 9).
328–9. Satan steered between Sagittarius (“the Centaure”) and Scorpio, thereby passing through Anguis, the
constellation of the Serpent.
342–5 listening. Satan evidently heard the “discourse” and “plaints” of Adam and Eve at 10.720–1096), which
thus precede his return to Hell; he also concluded that his own “doom” was “of future time.”
355 Trophies. Objects or persons captured in battle displayed in the triumphs accorded Roman generals and
emperors who won great military victories; here, the bridge itself is a trophy of victory.
381 Quadrature. The New Jerusalem is described as “foursquare” in Rev. 21:16. Satan’s new conquest, earth,
is an orb (“Orbicular”), so Sin implies its superiority since a sphere was thought to be more perfect than
a cube. Cf. PL 2.1048, where Heaven is said to be “undetermind square or round.”
386–7 Antagonist. The name “Satan” means Adversary or Antagonist.
390. The repeated word emphasizes that Satan is enacting a triumph, passing over a triumphal bridge rather
than through triumphal arches; the scene would likely evoke the Roman-style triumphal processions and
arches celebrating the Restoration of Charles II.
413–14 Planet-strook. The planets, stricken as by the malign influence of an adverse planet, suffered not
merely a temporary but a “real Eclips,” a permanent loss of light.
424–6 Pandæmonium. Literally “place of all demons”; it is termed the “seate” of “Lucifer” (Satan’s name before
his fall), in allusion to and comparison with the morning star named Lucifer (the light-bringer).
427 the Grand. “the grand infernal Peers” (cf. 2.507).
429–39 the Tartar. The simile compares the fallen angels’ withdrawal from other regions of Hell to guard
their metropolis to Tartars retiring before attacking Russians and to Persians retreating before attacking
Turks.
Astracan. A Tartar region near the mouth of the Volga, annexed by Ivan the Terrible in
1556.
Bactrian Sophi. Persian Shah (Bactria, modern Afghanistan, was a province of Persia).
Turkish Crescent. Refers both to the Turkish battle formations and to their emblem.
Realm of
Aladule. Armenia, whose last Persian ruler before the Turkish conquest, named Aladule, was forced to
retreat before the Turks to Tabriz (“Tauris”) in northwest Persia (Iran) or to Kazvin (“Casbeen”), north of
Tehran.
441–55. Satan’s invisble entry and sudden blazing forth recall the sudden appearance of the Sultan, Solimano,
in Tasso, Gerusalemme Liberata 10:32–50.
444 Plutonian. Infernal, from Pluto, the classical god who rules the underworld.
453 Stygian. Of the river Styx in Hades, the river of hate.
460–1. Satan declares that his followers now hold their titles “in possession” (de facto), by reason of his conquest of earth, not only “of right” (de jure) – a common legal distinction.
480. Protesting both to and against Fate.
503 bliss. Ironically, the final word of Satan’s triumphal speech rhymes with and prepares for the “hiss” that
will soon greet him (508).
511–47. The scene recalls Dante’s vivid description of the thieves metamorphosed into snakes (Inferno 24 –5).
524–6 Scorpion. This has a venomous sting at the tip of the tail.
Asp. A small Egyptian viper.
Amphisbœna. A mythical snake with a head at either end.
Cerastes. An asp with horny projections
over each eye.
Hydrus, and Ellops. Mythical water snakes.
Dipsas. A mythical snake whose
bite caused raging thirst.
527–8 Gorgon. Medusa. Ovid explains that the blood dropping from her severed head as Persius flew with
it over Libya accounts for the abundance of snakes in that country (Metamorphoses 4.617– 20). Milton’s catalogue of snakes recalls Lucan’s enumeration of the serpents that sprang from Medusa’s blood (Pharsalia
9.697–733).
Ophiusa. Greek, “full of serpents,” the name given to several islands, including Rhodes.
528–32 Dragon. Associated with Satan, cf. Rev. 12:9.
Python. A gigantic serpent engendered from the
slime left by Deucalion’s flood; Apollo slew him and appropriated the “Pythian Vale” and shrine at Delphi
(Metamorphoses 1.438–47), a narrative sometimes read as type of Christ’s victory over the “Dragon” Satan.
559–60 Megœra. One of the three Furies with snaky hair, goddesses of vengeance.
561–70 bituminous Lake. The Dead Sea, where “Sodom,” the evil city destroyed by fire and brimstone (“flamed”)
once stood (Gen. 19:24). Apples reputedly grew nearby, which looked good but dissolved into ashes when
touched. Milton’s scene also evokes the myth of Tantalus, from whom water and fruit receded every time
he reached for them to assuage his raging hunger and thirst (Odyssey 11.582 – 92). Cf. the curse on the serpent, “dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life” (Gen. 3:14).
574–6 lost shape. God permitted them to resume their shape as fallen angels, but turned them to serpents
in an “annual humbling.”
578–84 some tradition. The Titan “Ophion” (whose name means “Serpent”) and his wife “Eurynome” (the
wide-ruling or “wide- / Encroaching”) ruled Olympus until driven away by “Saturn” and his wife “Ops”;
they in turn were overthrown by “Dictæan Jove,” who lived in Crete on Mount Dicte. Milton suggests that
these myths represent versions of the fallen angels’ story transmitted by them to “the Heathen.”
586–8. Sin was “in power” in Eden in the actual sins of Adam and Eve; now Sin will dwell “in body,” as a
“Habitual” physical presence in all creatures, due to original sin.
589–90 pale Horse. Cf. Rev. 6:8, “Behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell
followed with him.” Death is “not mounted yet” because that action is predicted for the Last Days.
601 unhide-bound Corps. Death’s hunger is such that he can never fill out his skin, so his “hide” does not
cling close to his bones.
606 Sithe of Time. A familiar emblem shows Time (and Death) as a mower with a scythe.
620 wastful Furies. Avenging classical deities (the Eumenides), here, Sin and Death,
635
638–9. Cf. Rev. 21:1, “And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were
passed away.”
641–5. Cf. Rev. 19:6, “And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters,
and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying, Alleluia” and Rev. 16:7, “Even so, Lord God Almighty,
true and righteous are thy judgments.”
657 other five. Planets, see note to 5.176–8.
659. The positions of 60, 90, 120, and 180 degrees, respectively.
664–5 Winds. Often shown on early maps as blowing from the four “corners” of the earth.
668–80. The poem offers both a Copernican and a Ptolemaic explanation of the shifts made in the cosmos
so as to change the prelapsarian eternal spring, when the sun’s orbit was parallel to the equator,
“Equinoctial Rode.” The Copernican explanation (offered first) proposes that the axis of the earth, “the
Centric Globe,” is now tilted and the “Poles” turned “ascanse” (668 –71). The Ptolemaic explanation is that
the plane of the sun’s orbit is tilted (671–8) so that the sun journeys from Aries through the zodiac. In
spring and summer it passes a like declination (“Like distant breadth”) through “Taurus” and the Pleiades
(“the Seav’n / Atlantick Sisters”), Gemini (“the Spartan Twins”), and Cancer (“the Tropic Crab”). Then at
full speed (“down amaine”) it moves in late summer and autumn through “Leo,” Virgo (“the Virgin”), and
Libra (“the Scales”), to “Capricorne” in winter.
686–7 Estotiland. Northern Labrador.
Magellan. The Straits of Magellan, at the tip of South America.
688 Thyestean. Thyestes seduced the wife of his brother Atreus, who, in revenge, served one of Thyestes’
sons to him in a “Banquet.” The sun changed its course in horror.
696 Norumbega. Northern New England and maritime Canada.
Samoed. Northeastern Siberia.
698–706 Boreas . . . Cœcias . . . Argestes . . . Thrascias. All winds that blow from the north, northeast, and
northwest, bursting from the cave (“brazen Dungeon”) in which Aeolus had imprisoned the winds. “Notus
and Afer” come from Sierra Leone (“Serraliona”) on the west coast of Africa. Blowing across them
(“thwart”) are the “Levant” from the east and specifically the Levant region, and the “Ponent” (western)
winds “Eurus” (east-southeast), “Zephir” (the west wind), “Sirocco” (southeast) and “Libecchio” (southwest).
707 Discord. The classical Discordia was the sister of Death, hence “Daughter of Sin.”
711 graze the Herb all leaving. Vegetation and fruit were the prelapsarian foods of all creatures; meateating began with the Fall.
720 O miserable of happie. Adam’s “sad complaint” begins with the classical formula for a tragic fall, the
change from happiness to misery. Cf. Satan’s soliloquy on Mount Niphates (4.32–113).
738–41 Mine own. Adam’s “own” curse will remain “bide upon” him, and the curses of “all” his descendants will flow back (“redound”) on him as on their “natural center”; objects at that center (“in thir place”)
were thought to be weightless (“light”), but these curses will be “Heavie.”
743–6. Cf. Isa. 45:9: “Woe unto him that striveth with his Maker! . . . Shall the clay say to him that fashioneth it, What makest thou?”
760–5. Cf. Isa. 45:10: “Woe unto him that saith unto his father, What begettest thou?”
770 dust. Cf. Gen. 3:19: “dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.”
792. Adam concludes that the soul dies with the body; he has reasoned his way to part of Milton’s Mortalist
heresy (Christian Doctrine 1.13) but not the rest, that both body and soul rise again on the Last Day.
794–808 man is not so. Adam intuits an axiom of Scholastic philosophy, that the action of agents is limited
by the nature of the objects they act upon, so he reasons that “finite” matter cannot suffer “infinite” divine
punishment.
799 Strange contradiction. Adam concludes, with the Scholastics and Milton himself, that God cannot do
things that “imply a contradiction” (Christian Doctrine 1.2).
832–4 On mee, mee onely. Cf. the Son’s offer to accept all humankind’s guilt (3.236 –7) and Eve’s similar
offer (10.935–6).
860–2. Cf. Adam and Eve’s Morning Hymn (5:153–208, esp. 203 – 4).
867. Adam’s misogynistic outcry begins by reference to the patristic tradition that the name “Eve,” aspirated,
means “serpent.” Raphael (5:388–91) and Adam later (11.159 – 61) refer to the tradition that interprets her
name to mean “life”; cf. 9.1067.
884–6 a Rib / Crooked. A commonplace of misogynistic discourses.
887–8 supernumerarie. Some commentators claimed that Adam had thirteen ribs on the left side, so he could
spare one for the creation of Eve and still retain his “just number.”
889–90 Spirits Masculine. Cf. 1.423–5.
891–2 defect / Of Nature. Aristotle (De Generatione) termed the female a defective male.
917–18. Eve assumes the posture of a classical suppliant, clasping Adam’s knees as she begs for reconciliation.
936–7 Mee mee only. Cf. Adam’s cry at 832–4 above and the Son’s offer (3.236 – 7).
280
1030
1052–4. Adam echoes Elizabeth’s address to Mary, mother of Jesus, “Blessed is the fruit of thy womb” (Luke
1:42), alluding unaware to the promise about the “Seed” of the woman.
aslope. Like a spear that
“Glanc’d” aside from its target and hit the ground.
1075–8. Cf. Lucretius, De Rerum Natura 5.1091–5, for the theory that fire was discovered from lightning striking the forests.
Tine. Ignite.
thwart. Slanting.
1098–1104. The final six and a half lines repeat almost word for word lines 1086 – 92, only with changed verb
tenses, as Adam’s proposed gesture of repentance is seen to be carried out in every detail.
283
6 denounces. Proclaims.
1 stood. May mean “remained,” or that, after prostrating themselves (10.1099) they prayed standing upright;
their “port” was “Not of mean suiters” (8–9). Cf. 4.720–2.
3–5 Prevenient Grace. Grace preceding human choice, enabling the will (in bondage as a result of sin) to
repent. Cf. Ezek. 11:19, “I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will given them an heart of
flesh” – a proof-text for regeneration.
5–7 Unutterable. Cf. Rom. 8:26: “we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself
maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.”
10–14 ancient Pair. In a Greek myth analogous to the Noah story, “Deucalion” and his wife “Pyrrha” alone
survive a universal flood by building an ark. They then pray to “Themis,” goddess of justice, who tells
them to restore humankind by throwing stones behind them, which turn into men and women
(Metamorphoses 1.318–415).
18 incense. Cf. Rev. 8:3, “another angel came . . . having a golden censer; and there was given unto him
much incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which was before
the throne.”
25 Priest. In Christian Doctrine 1.15, Milton defines Christ’s priestly function as that whereby he “once offered
himself to God the Father as a sacrifice for sinners, and has always made, and still continues to make intercession for us.”
33–4 Advocate / And propitiation. Cf. 1 John 2:1–2: “We have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ
the righteous: And he is the propitiation for our sins.”
34–6 ingraft. The theological term for the Son taking to himself all the “works” of humans, perfecting their
good deeds by his “Merit” and by his “Death” paying the debt due God’s justice for their evil deeds.
42–4 Made one. Cf. John 17:22–3: “that they may be one, even as we are one: I in them, and thou in me,
that they may be made perfect in one.”
50–5 pure immortal Elements. These themselves “purge” man as a “distemper” (“unharmoneous” disorder), and “Eject” him from Eden to a place where the air and food are more “gross,” like himself,
disposing him for death, the “dissolution wrought by Sin.”
64 Faith and faithful works. Cf. Christian Doctrine 1.22: “we are justified by faith without the works of the
law, but not without the works of faith” – a qualification of the reformed doctrine of Sola Fides.
65 renovation. The resurrection and renewal of body and soul at the Last Day.
74–6. A trumpet sounded on Mount “Oreb” when God delivered the Ten Commandments to Moses (Exod.
19:19); it will sound again at the Last Judgment (“general Doom”).
83–98. Several phrases in God’s speech are closely quoted from Gen. 3:22–3: “And the Lord God said, Behold,
the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take
also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever: Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden
of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.” Milton adds the phrase, “dream at least to live /
For ever” (95–6) to signal that some of God’s statements (84 –5, 94 –5) are ironic.
115 As I shall thee enlighten. God, it seems, reveals the “future” events to Michael at the same time as
Michael presents them to Adam (see 12:128).
118–22. Cf. Gen. 3:24: “So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims,
and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.”
128–9 Cherubim; four faces each. Cf. Ezek. 1:10 and PL 6.753– 6.
Janus. The Roman god of doorways had two faces – in one version, four, corresponding to the four seasons and the four quarters of
the earth.
129–33 Argus. Argus, with one hundred eyes, was set by Juno to watch Jove’s mistress Io, but “Hermes” (Mercury)
put all of his eyes to sleep with his music (“Arcadian Pipe”) and his sleep-inducing caduceus (“opiate Rod”).
135 Leucothea. Roman goddess of the dawn.
155 promise. Cf. 10.179–81
158–60. Cf. Raphael’s salutation at 5.385–91. The name “Eve” is cognate with the Hebrew word meaning life.
172 sweat impos’d. Part of the punishment for the Fall, “In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread” (Gen.
3:19). Cf. PL 10.205.
185–6 Bird of Jove. The eagle swooped (“stoopt”) from his towering flight (“aerie tour”).
194–5 mute signs. Both scenes portray a regal creature (eagle, lion) driving forth a superlatively lovely pair.
Without making a specific interpretation Adam infers that they may be “Forerunners” of God’s purpose.
214–15 Mahanaim. “Jacob” gave this name, meaning “armies” or “camps” (“field Pavilion’d”) to a place where
he saw an army of angels (Gen. 32:1–2).
216–20 flaming Mount. The “Syrian King” had “levied Warr” against “Dothan” in an effort to capture Elisha
the prophet (“One man”), but God surrounded him on a mountain with horses and chariots of fire (2 Kgs
6:17).
240. Cf. Raphael’s appearance at 5.277–85.
242–4 Melibœan. Both Meliboea in Thessaly and “Sarra” (Tyre) were famous for purple dye (“grain”). “Iris”
as goddess of the rainbow (also the sign of God’s “Truce”) dyed the “wooff ” (threads woven across a
warp).
269–70 Native Soile. Unlike Adam, Eve was created in the “Paradise” of Eden.
277. Milton departs from Gen. 2:19–20, in which Adam alone gives names. The action of naming the flowers
(like Adam’s naming of the beasts, 8.352–5) signifies intuitive knowledge of their nature.
279 ambrosial Fount. See 4.237–40, describing the fount in Eden that “Ran Nectar.”
316. Cf. Gen. 4:14, Cain’s response to his punishment: “from thy face shall I be hid.”
323–6. The patriarchs raised “Altars” wherever God appeared to them.
357–8 future dayes. Prophetic visions are a common feature of epic, e.g., Aeneas’ vision of his descendants
culminating in the Roman empire (Aeneid 6.754–854).
367 drencht. Placed in her eyes a soporific liquid (drench).
380
381–4. When Satan tempted Christ (the subject of Milton’s brief epic, Paradise Regained) he took him to “an
exceeding high mountain” and showed him “all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them” (Matt.
4:8). Cf. Paradise Regained 3.251–4.169.
383–92. Christ, the “second Adam” (but not Adam, who is shown “nobler sights,” 411), will first view “destined” (yet to come) kingdoms in Asia: “Cambalu,” capital of Cathay (north China), ruled by such Khans
as Ghenghis and Kublei, “Cathaian Can”; “Temir” (Tamburlaine), ruled “Samarchand” (Samarkand), near
the “Oxus” river in modern Uzbekistan; “Paquin” (Peking, Beijing), of “Sinæan Kings” (Chinese); “Agra and
Lahor” (Lahore), “Mogul” capitals in northern India and Pakistan; “golden Chersonese,” the Malay peninsula
east of India, fabled for wealth.
393–6. Then Christ will see “Persian,” Russian, and Turkish kingdoms. In Persia (Iran), he will see “Ecbatan”
(Hamadan), a summer residence of Persian kings, and “Hispahan” (Isfahan), which became the Persian
capital in the sixteenth century. “Bizance” (Byzantium, Constantinople, Istanbul) was capital of the
Ottoman empire and ruled by “Sultans” after falling to the Turks in 1453.
397–401. In Africa he will see Abyssinia (northern Ethiopia), empire of the “Negus” (ruler) reaching to “Ercoco”
(Arkiko), a Red Sea port. Then “Mombaza” (Mombasa) and “Melind” (Malindi) in Kenya and “Quiloa” (Kilwa),
an island port off the coast of Tanzania; “Sofala,” a port in Mozambique, sometimes identified with the
biblical “Ophir,” from which Solomon took gold for his temple (1 Kgs 9:28); and “Congo” and “Angola” on
the west coast.
402–4. In North Africa, looking from the “Niger” river in west Africa flowing eastward to the Atlantic to the
“Atlas” mountains in Morocco (or possibly to Mout Atlas in Mauritania), he sees the kingdom of various
Muslim rulers called Al Mansur (“Almansor”), probably referring to Abu’Amir al Ma-Ma’afiri, Caliph of Cordova.
That empire takes in “Fez,” capital of Morocco, Tunis (“Sus”), “Algiers, “ and “Tremisen” (Tlemeen), part
of Algeria.
406–11. Christ will see places in the New World only “in Spirit,” probably because they lie on the other side
of the spherical earth: “Mexico” the seat of Montezuma (“Motezume”), the last Aztec emperor; “Cusco in
Peru” seat of Atahualpa (“Atabalipa”), the last Inca emperor, murdered by Pizarro; “yet unspoil’d / Guiana”
(a region including Surinam, Guyana, and parts of Venezuela and Brazil) – not yet discovered and plundered by the Spanish. Its chief city, Manoa, was identified with the mythical city of gold, “El Dorado,” by
“Geryons Sons” (the Spanish); in Spenser’s Faerie Queene Geryon, a mythical three-headed monster killed
by Hercules, is an allegory of the great power and oppression of Spain.
414 Euphrasie and Rue. Both herbs were thought to sharpen eyesight.
429–47. Milton’s version of the Cain and Abel story provides a clear reason for God’s acceptance of Abel’s
sacrifice, as Gen. 4:1–16 does not. Michael does not name any of the biblical personages or places in Book
11; he sees the scenes but may not know the names these persons or places will bear.
430–1 arable. Land capable of being ploughed.
tilth. Cultivated.
434–7 A sweatie Reaper. Cain. Cf. Gen. 4:2: “And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the
ground.”
441–2. Acceptable sacrifices were often consumed by “Fire from Heav’n”; Cf. Lev. 9:24 and Judg. 6:21.
455. Adam has to be told that these are his own sons, not simply descendants.
477–95. This is the only non-biblical sight presented to Adam, a “Lazar-house” or hospital for leprosy and
other infectious diseases, named for Lazarus (Luke 16:19 –25).
484–8 Stone. Morbid concretion.
Dæmoniac Phrenzie. Manic frenzy, often attributed to possession by evil spirits.
Moon-struck madness. Lunacy.
pining Atrophie. Emaciation.
Marasmus. A wasting away of the body.
wide-wasting Pestilence. Plague (the Great Plague of
1665 had killed over 60,000 Londoners).
Rheums. Rheumatic pains.
491. For Death’s “Dart” see 2.672, 786.
496 not of Woman born. A man’s tears and softer feelings were attributed to his feminine part; Adam was
created of the dust of the earth, not born of woman. Cf. Macbeth 5.8.13 –18.
511–13. Cf. Christian Doctrine 1.12: “some remnants of the divine image still exist in us, not wholly extinguished by this spiritual death.”
518 His Image. Man does not now bear God’s image but that of “ungovern’d appetite.”
542–4 Aire of youth. In assigning elements and humors to the several ages, “Aire” and the sanguine (“cheerful”) temperament arising from the blood were associated with youth; earth, and the melancholy temperament produced by phlegm and black bile (“cold and dry”) were associated with age. Cf. Robert Burton,
Anatomy of Melancholy (1621), 1.2.2, 1.3.5.
damp. Depression of spirits.
556–97 spacious Plaine. Adam’s third vision is based on Gen. 4:20 –2, of the three sons of Lamech, descendants of Cain.
557–8 Tents . . . Cattel. These identify the persons in the first part of this vision with Jabel, “the father of
such as dwell in tents, and of such as have cattle” (Gen. 4:20).
558–63 Instruments. Gen. 4:21 describes his brother Jubel as “father of all such as handle the harp and organ.”
563 fugue. Musical form in which one statement of the theme seems to chase another.
564–73 one who at the forge. Tubal-Cain, the third brother, was “an instructer of every artificer in brass
and iron” (Gen. 4:22).
570
574–80 a different sort. The descendants of Seth, Adam’s third son (Gen. 4:25 – 6).
hether side. The
Western (or hither) side, away from the east where Cain’s sons lived.
578–9 works / Not hid. Seth’s descendants were traditionally credited with the discovery of astronomy, a
lawful science not involving the “matters hid” that Raphael warned against. Or, perhaps, a contrast to
Tubal-Cain’s delving for hidden metals (cf. 1.687–8).
588–9 Eevning Star. Venus, planet of love.
591 Hymen. God of marriage.
613–14 a beauteous ofspring. The “Beavie of fair Women” (582).
621–5 Sons of God. Like most exegetes of Gen. 6:2, Milton identifies them as the descendants of Seth; the
women they wed (termed the daughters of men) are the descendants of Cain. Another tradition held that
angels lay with these women (cf. 3.461–3).
625–6 swim. An anticipation of the Flood to come, which Adam does not yet understand.
632–3 woe / . . . Woman. Adam produces another false etymological pun (a misogynist cliché), like his
earlier pun on “Eve . . . evil” (9.1067).
640
638–73 Adam’s fourth vision is of the Giant offspring of the previous marriages (683–5). Cf. Gen. 6:4: “There
were giants in the earth in those days, and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men
of renown.” Some details recall scenes from the shield of Achilles – siege, cattle raid, battle, assembly
(Iliad 18.490–616).
656 Batterie. Battering rams.
Scale. Ladders.
Mine. Tunnels under the walls.
665–71 one rising. Enoch, who “walked with God, and he was not, for God took him” (Gen. 5:24). He was
translated to heaven at 365 years of age, “middle Age” compared to other patriarchs (Adam 930, Seth 912).
689–99 Might only. The traditional values of epic, which Milton critiques in the Proem to Book 9.
what most merits fame. Cf. 9.31–3, “the better fortitude / Of Patience and Heroic Martyrdom /
Unsung.”
700–9. Jude 14 identifies Enoch as “the seventh from Adam.” Some details are drawn from Jude 14–15, describing Enoch’s prophecy of God’s pronouncing judgment with “ten thousand of his saints” on those “that
are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all their
hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him.” The “Cloud with winged Steeds” may be
taken from Elijah’s translation to heaven (2 Kgs 2:11), often associated with Enoch’s.
703 daring single to be just. Cf. Abdiel at 6.30–2.
712–53. Adam’s fifth vision, of the general depravity of humans, the Flood, and Noah (“a Reverend Sire,”
719) is based on Gen. 6:5–9:17. The “Sea without shoar” (750) and some other details of lines 738–53 are
taken from the story of Deucalion’s Flood in Metamorphoses 1.262–347.
730 Cubit. Ancient unit of measurement, from the elbow to the fingertip; the ark was 300 by 50 by 30 cubits
(Gen. 6:15).
735 seavens, and pairs. Cf. Gen. 7:2, “Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and
his female; and of beasts that are not clean by two, the male and his female.”
764–6. Cf. Matt. 6:34: “Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.”
768 foreknowledge. The term suggests that Adam is experiencing something akin to God’s foreknowledge,
which the poem insists is not predestination. Adam knows what is to happen but can neither cause it nor
prevent it.
768–9 Birth / Abortive. Their birth seems to Adam both monstrous and too soon born.
797–806. These lines may also allude to the backsliding Puritans who betrayed the Commonwealth in 1660
and have now taken on the vices of the restored royalists.
808 One Man except. Noah.
831 horned floud. Classical river gods were often depicted as horned.
833 the great River. The Euphrates (see Gen. 15:18).
the op’ning Gulf. The Persian Gulf.
844–6. Cf. 5.423–6.
851 som high mountain. Mount Ararat (Gen. 8:4).
857–60 once and agen. Noah sent forth a “Dove” twice; the first time it failed to “spie” land, the second
time it returned with an “Olive leafe” (Gen. 8:8–12), a sign of peace (“pacific signe”).
866 three listed colours. Bands of the primary colors, red, blue, and yellow.
gay. Bright.
867 Cov’nant new. See below, 892–5 and note.
876–8. The language invites recognition of Noah as a type (foreshadowing) of Christ, the one “perfet” and
“just” who will cause God to forget “his anger.”
886–7. Cf. Gen. 6:6: “it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his
heart.”
892–5. This covenant marked by the rainbow – that God will not again destroy the earth by flood (Gen.
9:15–17) – is a type of the covenant of grace through which God will save humankind.
899. Cf. Gen. 8:22: “While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and
winter, and day and night shall not cease.”
900–1. The restoration of nature following the Flood is seen as a type of the renewal of all things after the
final conflagration at the Last Judgment, “new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness”
(2 Pet. 3:13).
5
1 succeed. Follow after.
7 second stock. from Noah himself, but also as a type of Christ in whom believers are ingrafted; see 3.287–89.
9 mortal sight to faile. Adam no longer sees the visions or pageants as before, but simply listens to Michael’s
narration; cf. Rom. 10:17, “So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.” Michael,
however, continues to see the visions (128).
24–35 one. Nimrod. Cf. Gen. 10:8–10: “And Cain begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth.
He was a mighty hunter before the Lord . . . And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel.” Milton identifies
Nimrod as the first king, in terms that equate kingship with tyranny. He explains “before the Lord” as
meaning either that he openly defied God (“despite,” 34) or that he claimed divine right (“second
Sovrantie,” 35) from heaven, like the Stuart kings.
29 law of Nature. Grounded in reason, and dictating a government based on “fair equalitie, fraternal state” (26).
36–7. Drawing upon a false etymology linking the name Nimrod with the Hebrew “to rebel,” Milton
associates Nimrod with kingship generally (cf. 1.484 and 6.199 for other rebel kings). The lines allude also
especially to Charles I, who accused the Puritans of rebellion in the Civil War but who in Milton’s view
was himself a rebel against God for usurping the absolute monarchy belonging only to God.
40–59 Plain. The plain of Shinar in ancient Babylon (“Sennaar,” 3.467). Gen. 11:4 describes the building of
the “Towre” of Babel and refers to the “Citie” (Babylon). “And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and
a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven, and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon
the face of the whole earth.” Though Genesis does not directly associate Nimrod with the tower, he was
traditionally made responsible for both tower and city (Gen. 10:9 –10).
62 Confusion. Taken to be the meaning of “Babel,” where God in punishment confounded the original language of humans into multiple languages (Gen. 11:9).
64–71 aspire / Above his Brethren. Adam’s response suggests that republicanism is a matter of natural law,
clearly understood as such by Adam; he echoes an argument Milton often invoked to support republicanism against monarchy.
81–90 Rational Libertie. As Milton often did and as Abdiel did earlier (6.179 – 81), Michael links political to
psychological servility, and political liberty to inner freedom, i.e., the exercise of “right Reason” and control of passions.
90–101. This passage, presenting loss of liberty as often (though not always) God’s punishment for a nation’s
servility. implicitly interprets the Restoration of Charles II as a divine judgment on the baseness of the
English.
101–4 th’ irreverent Son. Ham, son of Noah, looked on the nakedness of his father and brought down Noah’s
curse upon himself and his “vitious Race” (depraved descendants): “Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren” (Gen. 9:25). Milton is probably thinking of the Canaanites (descendants of Ham’s son Canaan), since “Race” did not carry its modern meaning. Noah’s curse was used, however,
to justify black slavery, as blacks came to be classed among Ham’s descendants.
111 one peculiar Nation. Israel, specially chosen by God, cf. Deut. 14:2, “The Lord hath chosen thee to be
a peculiar people unto himself.” In Christian Doctrine 1.4 Milton notes the “national election, by which
God chose the whole nation of Israel for his own people.” And, like many Puritans, he thought for a time
that God had chosen England as a new Israel.
113 one faithful man. Abraham, whose name means “father of many nations.” Lines 113 –51 are based on
Gen. 11:27–17:9.
115 Bred up in Idol-worship. Tereh, Abraham’s father, worshiped idols.
117 Patriark. Noah, who lived 350 years after the Flood.
125–6 his Seed. Cf. Gen. 12:3: “in thee shall all families of the earth be blest.” Michael restates that prophecy
and applies it to the Messiah, the Seed of the woman (148 –50).
127–9 with what Faith. Cf. Heb. 11:8: “By faith Abraham, when he was called . . . obeyed; and he went
out, not knowing whither he went.” Adam, who no longer sees the visions, must accept the story of Abraham
by “Faith,” analogous to the faith Abraham himself displays.
130 Ur. A city on the west bank of the Euphrates, in the region of “Chaldæa.”
131 Haran. A city in northwestern Mesopotamia (now Turkey), reached by a “Ford” across one of the tributaries of the Euphrates.
135 Canaan. The Promised Land of the Hebrews, in the area of modern Israel and the West Bank.
136 Sechem. Modern Nablus, a city in central Canaan.
137–46 by promise. Cf. God’s promise to Abraham (Gen. 12:7), “Unto thy seed will I give this land.” Also
Gen. 17:8, “I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land wherein thou art a stranger, all the
land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession.” The Promised Land was bounded on the north by
“Hamath,” a city on the Orontes river in west Syria; on the south by the wilderness (“Desert”) of Zin; on
the east by “Mount Hermon”; and on the west by the Mediterranean Sea, the “great Western Sea.”
143–7 Mount Carmel. A mountain range near Haifa, on the Mediterranean coast of Israel.
Jordan. The
river was thought incorrectly to have two sources (“double-founted”), the Jor and the Dan.
Senir.
A ridge of Mount Hermon.
152 faithful Abraham. This is the first personal name Michael identifies; he later supplies several names of
persons and places. Abraham is given the epithet “faithful” by Paul in Gal. 3:9.
153 Son. Isaac.
Grand-childe. Jacob.
155–64. Jacob’s son Joseph, the next youngest of his twelve sons, rose to a high position in Egypt and invited
his father and brothers to that land to escape famine; his story is told in Gen. 37–50.
158. Adam can evidently see geographical features, but not the scenes or persons Michael sees and describes.
165–214. The story of the Israelites enslaved in Egypt and freed by “Moses” and “Aaron” is told in Exod. 1–14.
172 spoile. “jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment” (Exod. 12:35).
175–90 Signes and Judgements. The ten plagues God sent upon the Egyptians to force Pharaoh to release
the Israelites.
191 River-dragon. Literally, the crocodile, here referring to the Egyptian Pharaoh, termed “the great dragon
that lieth in the midst of his rivers” (Ezek. 29:3).
193–4 Ice / More hard’nd. Ice which thawed and then was refrozen was thought to be harder than nevermelted ice.
194–214 Sea / Swallows him. Pharaoh’s forces (“Host”) were drowned in the Red Sea as it rushed back
after the “rod of Moses” caused it to divide, forming “two crystal walls” which the Israelites passed between
(Exod. 14:5–31.).
201–4 present in his Angel. Milton’s explanation, here and also in Christian Doctrine 1.5, as to how the Lord
guided his people in a “Cloud” and a “Pillar of Fire” (Exod. 13:21–2).
216 not the readiest way. The Israelites’ passage through the desert lasted thirty-eight years (Exod.
13:17–18).
225 great Senate. The Seventy Elders of the Sanhedrin (Num. 11:16 –25), which Milton cites as a divinely
ordained pattern of republican government in his Readie and Easie Way (1660).
226–32 Laws. God delivered ceremonial, civil, and moral/religious laws (the Ten Commandments) to Moses
on “the Mount of Sinai,” with “Thunder Lightning and loud Trumpets” (Exod. 19 –23).
232–3 types / And shadowes. The principle of typology, whereby persons and events in the Hebrew Bible
are understood to prefigure Christ or matters pertaining to his life or to the church.
236–8. Cf. the Israelites’ plea to Moses, “Speak thou with us and we will hear: but let not God speak with
us, lest we die” (Exod. 20:19).
240–4 Mediator. Moses is a type (“figure”) of Christ in his role as mediator between the people and God;
“all the Prophets”: in Christian typological explication, the prophets of the Hebrew Bible were read as
foretelling Christ as Messiah.
247–56 Tabernacle. A portable “Sanctuary” (Exod. 25–6).
256–7. Cloud . . . fiery gleame. Described in Exod. 40:38.
259–60 Land. Canaan; see 137–46 and note.
263–9. At Joshua’s bidding, the sun stood still in “Gibeon,” and the moon in “Aialon,” (both a few miles north
of Jerusalem) “until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies,” the Amorites ( Josh.
10:12–13).
Israel. Isaac’s son Jacob was named Israel (“He that striveth with God”) and his descendants (“descent”) would come to be known as the Children of Israel (Gen. 32:28).
273–7 Mine eyes true op’ning. Adam supposes that the promise made to him pertains to Abraham’s seed,
but he has yet to understand that Abraham is, in this, a type of Christ (see below, 446 –50).
291–9 shadowie expiations. The ceremonial sacrifices of “Bulls and Goats” under the Law are types pointing to Christ’s efficacious sacrifice, which alone can win “Justification” for humankind, by Christ’s merits
being “imputed,” attributed vicariously, to them through “Faith.” The theological doctrine of justification
holds that fallen humans cannot perform the commandments of the Law, or appease God through ceremonial sacrifices. Cf. Gal. 2:16: “A man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus
Christ.”
305
300–6. A more complete exposition of the theological concept of typology, according to which Judaism foreshadows and is perfected by Christianity, the Old Law of justice is fulfilled in the New Law of love, and
the covenant made with Moses is superseded by a “better Cov’nant,” the covenant of grace (cf. Heb. 8:6).
310–14 Jesus. The Greek equivalent of the Hebrew “Joshua,” who, rather than Moses, led the Children of
Israel into the promised land of Canaan, being in this a type of Christ leading his people to the heavenly
paradise.
320–34 Judges. Military leaders. The history briefly summarized here is recounted in Judges, 1 and 2 Sam.,
and 1 and 2 Kgs.
321–4 The second. The second king of Israel was David, promised by the prophet Nathan that “thy throne
shall be established for ever” (2 Sam. 7:16).
325–7 Royal Stock. The Messiah was prophesied to come of David’s lineage, and Jesus was referred to as
Son of David (Luke 1:32).
332–4 his next Son. Solomon, noted for “Wisdom,” built a “glorious Temple” to house the Ark of the Covenant
(1 Kgs 6–7).
clouded Ark. So called because “a cloud covered the tent of the congregation” which
held the Ark when the Israelites wandered in the desert (Exod. 40:34).
339–45 proud Citie. Babylon. The Babylonian captivity and the destruction of the Temple (sixth century
BCE) are recounted in 2 Kgs 25 and Jer. 39:1–10.
346–50 Cov’nant sworn. The promise to David to make “his throne as the days of heaven” (Ps. 89:29).
leave of Kings. The Persian kings Cyrus the Great, Darius, and Artaxerxes allowed the Israelites to return
from Babylon and rebuild the Temple (Ezra).
353–7 Priests dissension. Strife among the priests allowed the Selucid king Antiochus IV to sack Jerusalem
and pollute the Temple; then one of the priestly family of the Maccabees, Aristobulus I, seized the “Scepter,”
disregarding the claims of David’s dynasty.
358 stranger. Antipater the Idumean, father of Herod the Great who ruled at the time of Christ’s birth, was
procurator of Judaea from 47 BCE.
365
360–9. The story of the birth of Jesus is recounted in Matt. 1–2 and Luke 1–2.
370–1. An echo of Virgil’s prophecy of Augustus (Aeneid 1.287), “imperium Oceano, famam qui terminet
astris” (“he will bound his empire with the ocean, his glory with the stars”).
379. Cf. 5.385–7 and Luke 1:28.
400 theirs. Your descendants’ transgressions which grow out of “thine.”
401–10. Michael restates the theological doctrine that Christ as “Saviour” will stand in place of humankind,
redressing their disobedience by his perfect “obedience” and suffering the “death” that was their punishment. Humans can only be saved by Christ’s “merits” attributed to them vicariously (“Imputed”), not by
their own good works even if “legal,” conforming to God’s law.
403–4 love. Cf. Rom. 13:10, “Love is the fulfilling of the law.”
406. Cf. Gal. 3:13, “Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree.”
426–7 Faith not void of workes. Humans can obtain the “benefit” of Christ’s merits only by “Faith,” but
not without the “workes” that flow from faith. Cf. 11.64 and note, and also Jas. 2:26, “faith without works
is dead.”
447–50. Michael here makes explicit the meaning of the promise offered typologically to Abraham’s seed.
454 Prince of aire. One of Satan’s titles; cf. Eph. 2:2, “prince of the power of the air.”
469–78. These lines do not affirm a simple concept of felix culpa – that the Fall was fortunate in bringing
humans greater happiness than they would otherwise have enjoyed – but rather, that the Fall provided
God an occasion to bring still greater good out of evil. Cf. 5.496 –503 for the prelapsarian plan for Adam
and Eve’s growth in perfection.
486 Comforter. The Holy Spirit, who for Milton is much subordinate to both Father and Son.
489 upon thir hearts. Cf. Heb. 8:10, “I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts.”
491–2 spiritual Armour. Cf. Eph. 6:11–16: “Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand
against the wiles of the devil . . . Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench
all the fiery darts of the wicked.”
505
501 speak all Tongues. Cf. Acts. 2:4–7, where the apostles speak in many tongues.
506 story written. In the Gospels and Epistles.
507–11 Wolves. Cf. Acts 20:29: “after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing
the flock.” See “Lycidas,” 113–29.
513–14. The Bible (“those written Records pure”) can only be rightly understood by the illumination of the
Spirit in each Christian.
515–37. The history summarized is of the corruption of the Church and persecutions of conscience in patristic times and after, under the popes and Christian rulers, but the passage also alludes to what Milton saw
as the revival of “popish” superstitions in the English Church after the Restoration and the fierce persecution of dissenters.
526 his consort Libertie. Cf. 2 Cor. 3:17: “Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.” Milton insisted
in his prose tracts that Christ’s gospel and the Spirit of God promote liberty, civil and religious.
527 living Temples. Individual Christians, cf. 1 Cor. 3:16: “Know ye not that ye are the temple of God.”
529–30 Infallible. An attack on papal claims of infallibility, asserted though not proclaimed as doctrine until
1870; the attack extends to all religious or civil leaders who attempt to impose an orthodoxy.
543–51. With the account of the Second Coming of Christ, the Last Judgment, and the renewal of all things,
the meaning of the “Womans seed” destroying Satan’s works is made fully explicit. Cf. 2 Pet. 3:13, “we,
according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth.”
570
567–68 weak / Subverting worldly strong. Cf. 1 Cor. 1:27: “God hath chosen the weak things of the world
to confound the things which are mighty.”
587 paradise within thee. Compare Satan’s interior state at 4.20 –2, 75.
589 Speculation. Both extensive view and theological inquiry.
611–13 Dreams advise. The lines suggest that Eve’s dream was also a vehicle of prophecy to her. Cf. Num.
12:6: “If there be a prophet among you, I the Lord will make myself known unto him in a vision, and will
speak unto him in a dream.”
615–18 with thee to goe. Eve’s last love lyric in the poem invites comparison with her prelapsarian lyric
(4.641–56); it also echoes Ruth’s promise to accompany her mother-in-law Naomi: “whither thou goest,
I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge” (Ruth 1:16).
621–3. In these lines Eve describes herself as the central epic protagonist of the poem, through whom “all”
is lost and “all” is restored.
